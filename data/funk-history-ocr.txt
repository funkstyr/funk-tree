PREFACE.

At the suggestion of a friend, a Funk by name, and a
descendant of Bishop Henry Funck, and who was greatly
interested in the work, we consented to, and arranged
with him to compile a history of the Funk family.

The work was commenced in the spring of 1891. The
family is an old one, originally either from Holland or
the Palatinate in Germany, and already traces of some
of the second generation have been lost sight of, or some
of them may have left no issue.

We have made it our earnest endeavor to make the
work as complete as possible.

In some instances, however, the records are incom-
plete, owing to the lack of interest manifested by some
of the descendants in the work, and who fatled to respond
to communications asking for information,

We however acknowledge ourselves greatly indebted
to many of the friends who manifested a lively interest in
the work, for their kind favors in furnishing information
for the same. More prominent among those who gave us
much assistance are the following: Miss Sue Funk, Kentl-
worth, Pa.; D, K, Cassel, Philadelphia, Pa.; James Y.
Heckler, Hatfield, Pa,; H. W. Gross, Doylestown, Pa.;
Eld, John F, Funk, Elkhart, Ind; Rev. H. R. Funk, Phil-
adelphia, Pa.; H. 8S. Funk, Springtown, Pa; Rev. Abel
Bean, Ironbridge, Pa.; Rev. H. A. Hunsicker, Mont Clare,
Pa., and others,

INTRODUCTION.

The best lessons of our lives are those we learn from
actual experience,

History holds up to our view the wisdom as well as
the follies, the good as well as the bad acts of men who
have lived before us,

From the experiences and the necessities of the men
of the past we learn how knowledge develops and how
men make progress in arts, science and general intelli-
gence, :

The world’s history is a record of events that have
taken place in the development and progress of nations,
tribes and peoples that have inhabited the earth aince
time began,

While arta, science, philosophy, inventions, educa-
tion, literature, politics, religion, social science, war and
the works of nature have all contributed to the records
of history, by far the greater portion of the world’s writ-
ten history has been drawn from the events associated
‘with war and politics, :

Writers of history seem to have taken a special in-
terest in recording and bringing before the minds of the
people the glory of human strife, and in honoring and ap-
plauding those who have distinguished themselves in the
scenes of carnage and the destruction of human life; and
{n thie way the common mind has been especially edu-
cated to delight itself in the study and contemplation of
scenes of horror and human misery, and by this means
cultivating and perpetuating the spirit and practice of
war, malevolence and acvastation; and we, no doubt,
-have all, toa greater or Jess degree, aided in and given
our influence to the bringing about of such a condition of
things,

While this book contains biographical sketches of
soldiers, and men who have given their lives to this sad
work, and of others who have no special regard for relig-
{on and religious principles, and of some of whom it may
indeed be sald that they have lived “without God in the
world,” yet the large majority of them are men who have
been identified with the peaceful doctrines of the gospel
of Christ, men of more decided religious views, and who
were devoted and fully consecrated to the teachings of
the word of God, men who suffered much for conscience’
sake and yet remained faithful, men who followed their
Lord through evil report and through good report, and
who made {t a principle of their Hves never to do any-
thing to the injury of their fellow-men,

We are glad that a history of the “quiet people of
the laud” is to be brought before the public mind, or we
may say, we are glad tbat a number of histories of this
class of people are being brought before the public, for
this is really a phase in history that has been greatly
overlooked. The public life of a nation or a people, in
which only the warlike and the political aspects are pre-
sented, shows only one side of the picture. The quiet, ev-
ery day life, the earnest, devoted, faithful heroes that
make up the bone and sinew of a nation, in their daily
‘toll, on the farm, in the work shop, in the home and {n
their religious bearing, form another aspect of Hfe
which must necessarily be brought out. in order to show
what.the people really are, and'this is what a book of this
kind will do, :

It ig one of the marked signs of progress and develop>
‘ment in civilized life, one: of the signs of progreas and
development in the right direction. ‘These are the
‘things the good people that have lived in the world have
toolong neglected. The “quiet people” became too quiet,
—#o quiet indeed that in too large a degree their light
was hid under a bushel, and toa very large extent their
influence for good was lost, and now that we see-a wave
coming up, bearing on its crest the white foam ot peace
and purity, telling of the life and labors, the faithful-
ness, devotion and quiet endurance of brave and noble
men and women who have stood by the noble, though de-
spised, principles of the gon: el of peace, whose names the
world never heard, whose fane neither bard nor poet ever

sung, and which were never written in their country’s
history, and whove deeds of love and charity were never
blazoned before the admiring multitude, that children
and children's cuildren might learn from the pure, gen-
tle, peaceful ways of their ancestors the grand lessons of
truly great aud noble lives, we have cause for rejoicing,
In this indved we see the marks of human progress,

It ic a declaration of the divine Word that “he that
ruleth his own spirit is greater than he that taketh a
city.” So is he that standeth by the pure principles of
the gospel, the life of peace, of righteousness and true
charity, though his life be an humble one, a greater man
and more worthy of true honor, than he who through
mighty deeds of valor by force of arms or the display of
physical strength and at the expense of others, has won
the applause of men, enjoyed the honors of the world and
gone to his grave amidst the pageantry and applause of
admiring multitudes,

May the history of that form of life which leads up-
ward and makes us grow day by day more godlike, more
divine, engage our thoughts more and more, and ever
find more acceptance in the minds of our people and na-

tion,
JOHN F. Funk,

Funck, all his children are named in the order of birth as
near as possible, Then follows his oldest son John Funk
(IL, generation), and his children (IIL generation) next,
Anna, being the oldest, is followed down to the last of
her descendants; then the second in order of birth of
the III, generation, and so on until the end of the entire
branch of John Funk of the II, generation is reached,

Then the second gon of Bishop Henry Funck of the I.

THE FUNK FAMILY HISTORY.

|. Bishop Henry Funck, born in Europe, either in
Holland, or the Palatinate, emigrated to America in
1719, settled at Indian Creek, in Franconia Twp., Montg.
Co., Pa., where he died in 1760, He was married to Anne
Meyer, daughter of the pioneer Christ'an Meyer, of Sal-
ford Twp., Montg. Co., who emigrated from Europe to
America about 1700.: Anne, wife of Henry Funck, dled
July 8, 1768, moe

' Henry Funck purchased three tracts of land, in all
201 acres, lying along’ the Indian Creek; in Franccula
Twp., Montg. Co., Pa., where he settled and built the firat
mill on the Indian Creek.

* “A warrant bearing date December 20, 1718, was
granted to Henry Funck, then of Germantown, by: the
_ commissioners of property, Richard Hill, Isaac Norris,

and James Logan, and by'virtue and in pursuance: of sald
warrant ‘there was surveyed to him a certain tract of
land situated on a branch of the Perkeawming Creek,’
containing 101 acres and three-quarters, with allowance
of aix per cent, being in all about 108 acres, This tract
extended from a certain corner south-west 166 perches,
then north-west 104 perches, then north-east 163 perches,
and then south-east 104 perches, for which he paid £20, in
lawful money, and the annual quitvent of one shilling per
100 acres, on the firet day of the first month (March), and
for this tract he received a patent dated Dec, 20, 1783.

He afterwards purchased two adjacent tracts from
James Steel of Philadelphia, one of these tracts situated
south-east of his first purchase, tie whole length ‘thereof
containing 53 acres, for which he paid £10, and received
a conveyance Dec, 24, 1719, which |s witnessed by Jacob

Taylor and Lydia Bolton. The other tract containing 40
acres, for which he also paid £10, and received a convey-
ance dated Nov. 14, 1729, The three tracts constituted
his farm of 201 acres on the Indian Creek, He afterwards
divided this farm into two unequal parts, granting 137
acres 146 perches to his son Christian, and 63 acres 19
perches with the mill and other buildings and improve-
ments to his son Abraham,

At the time of the division of this land, there probably
were two dwellings there, one for the farmer, and one for
the miller.”

The house opposite the mill isa very old structure,
.and was probably built by Bishop Henry Funck. The mill
was twice burned down, and rebuilt, and nothing but the
foundation of the original remains.

’ Besides his 201 acres on the Indian Creek, he also
owned a farm of 166 acres which he purchased “‘of ye
Mannor Landa, on ye upper part of a branch of Perck-
yoming, for £160,” probably a part of the Manor of
Perkasie, in Hilltown Twp., Bucks Co., and which he
willed to his son Henry, He also owned another tract
with buildings and improvements, which he. had pur-
chased from Ebenezer Kinnesly, and where his son-in-law,
Jacob Bare, lived. : .

Christian Funk, in his‘“Mirror to all Mankind,” says,
that his father “came from Europe in 1719, settled at the
Indian Creek; other of his brethren came over from
Europe and then Henry Funk was elected as minister to
serve the church at Franconia,” of which he was the first
minister, and later was ordained bishop in which office he
served a long time, . .

He held his membership at Franconia, and besides
ministering to that congregation, he also preached at
Clemen's, now Salford; in Skippack, and the “Plaifis,”
which included Hatfield and -Towamencin, and other
places, ,

‘ Henry Funck was the author of two religious works,
one a small book in German entitled, “Spiegel der
Taufc”—Mirror of Baptism, and the other a larger work,
entitled, “Eine Restitution, oder eine Erklaerung einiger
Hauptpunkte den Gesetzes,” which was published after
his death in 1768, and was reprinted at Biel, Switzerland,
in 1844, and at Lancaster, Pa., in 1962, :

He also, in connection with Dielman Kolb, was ap-
pointed by the Mennonite church to supervise the trans-
lation of van Bracht’s Martyrs Mirror, or “Der Blutige
Schauplatz,” from the Dutch to the German, a folio of
1514 pages printed at Ephrata in 1748. It was one of the
largest works published in this country during the Colonial
period,

Bishop Henry Funck was well educated for the times,
and was a man of extensive influence in his church and
community, He was a faithful and zealous servant for
his Master, and did much to advance the interests of his
church, . .

His Will which was very lengthy and explicit, he
wrote with his own hand—June 13, 1759, in the German
language. '

In its provisions and composition it is a somewhat
singular document, “but to the sincere Christian it has
lessons of instruction and examples, in the highest degree
worthy of imitation, while to the large number of the
descendants of its author, it is full of interest,” and is
herewith produced in full.

The Last Will and Testament of Henry Funck.

Franconia Township, the 13th of June, 1759,
The last Will and Testament of me, Henry Funck.

Whereas we know that we have no permanent sition in
this world of trouble, but must by death depart there-
from in hopes of a better Kingdom: it is therefore in
my mind as if my departure were nigh at hand, though
ye time is unknown to me. And as God his blessed me
and my late wife with a numerous family of children,
as well as my endeavors in obtaining a livelihood, I do,
therefore, judge it to be my duty to put down in writ-
ing what I ordain shall be observed after my said de-
parture, And as it is hard for me to see how I shal)
order all matters right, I shall therefore herein act 28
well as I can according to the best of my understani-
ing as followeth. And do hereby wish unto all herein ~
concerned, peace and righteousness, in ye Name of the
Lord,

I. After I am departed this life, I desire to be decently
buried after our usual and Christian manner.

Il, All my Funeral Expenses and all my just Debts shall be
previously paid out of my Estate, that no person may
suffer loss thereby, :

III, As on ye 8th day of July, 1758, my first wife, Anne,
died, and as there is no second, no regulations on that
account are neceasary,

IV. For as much as my daughter Esther is lame in all
her limbs, and to this day, can neither stand nor walk,
alone herself, nor any likelihood appears she ever will,
therefore, it is necessary this my daughter should be
provided with her mainterance, 1 do, therefore, as
Father, give her: First,—a good, complete, new suit of
apparel, such as is usual amongat us: Secondly,—Bed-
sted and a good bedding ye same, viz: under and over
Bed and Pillows, all well cased or covered: Thirdly, —
£400; I'say Four Hundred Pounds, good.Current Money
out of my Lands: Fourthly,—As my late Father-in-law,
Christian Meyer, bequeathed, unto ye said lame Esther,
the sum of £3; which said Three Pounds I have re-
celved, and ye same shall also be added for ye use of ye
said Esther, with ye interest thereof, It is, therefore,
my.will that.ye said Esther shall of ye same what I, by
ye Divine blessings, have been enabled to bequeath and
give unto her, be well maintained and attended by my
Executors, and her Brethren and Sisters, by reason of
her being in so poor and helpless a condition,

V. For, and in which case, and the management thereof,
I do appoint as Directors therein, ye Elders in the Con-
gregation of Christ, named ye Mennonists, wherein I
was a Servant Minister a long time, namely Christian
Meyer and Michael Dirstein, and their successors in ye
ministry with consent of their fellow ministers; and if
contrary to my expectations through or by reason of
any accidents or alteration befalling my Executors or
my Heirs, it should happen that their love toward their
said poor Sister should decrease, and she should be not
duly regarded or attended, I do then, in such case, fully .
empower ye said Elders and Ministers, of ye aforesaid
Congregation, to call my Executors, or their heirs and
executors, to account in regard of all what I have given
unto ye said Esther, and to take all what is left thereof


============================================================

============================================================

—~b—

into their custody, and therout, as long as it lasts,
Provide for ye said Esther; put her to @ good place,
and pay for ye same, And after Esther ig departed
this life, and everything relating to her paid off, then,
the remainder thereof, if any, shall go unto my heirs:
and I am in- hopes, my Executorg and Heirs, as well ag
ye Elders of ye said Congregation, will accept of this
of me in good Part, and observe their Christian Duty
herein in regard of ye said poor Esther, which Divine
favor may grant, Item.—It is also my will that beside
the sald new suit of apparel and bed for ye said Esther,
all her future new apparel and bedding shall be bought
and paid out of ye aforesaid money unto her given,
and whosoever shall best keep and provide the ‘said

Money out of her abovesaid Estate; and if by reason of
any accidental increase of infirmities, that should not
be enough yearly, then an addition shall be made
thereto, at ye discretion and with consent of said, In
this manner, it is my will, that ye said Esther shall, -be
kept, in health and sickness, in meat and drink, and
lodging, and be kept clean, in washing and mending of
clothes and bedding; and be also kept clean of lice and
other vermin, as well as of all other uncleanness,

VI. My eldest Son, John Funck, shall gratis enjoy his hay-
ing got his trade and have £5, I say Five Pounds iu
Money beside, and Over, and above his equal share
which he is to have with his other brethren and sisters,

VII. For and touching my lands, whereon I lived, I have
certain 137 acres, 1 gay one hundred and thirty-seven
acres and 146 perches thereof, heretofore given unto
ye possession of my son Christian Funck, For 136 acres
thereof, he shall pay £362, I say Three Hundred and
Sixty-two Pounds, and in consideration of the remain-
ing one acre and 146 perches thereof, he shall leave
unto ye Miller (my son Abraham Funck,) sufficient
ground and room on ye said land for hig Mill-dam ang
head and tail race for ye accommodation of the said
Mill, in such manner as may best be done and as the
same is occupied at present, and uccasion no hindrance
in regard of water of the said Mill. On the other hand,
ye said Miller shall let him who hath the aforesaid

—16—

plantation (as ye residuary part of ye same Tract of
Land) have a road by or nezr ye said Mill House and
Mill, into his field towards y: Burying-r-ound: and as
there is yet besides remairing certain other 63 acres, I
say Sixty-three acres and (9 perches of land of ye same
tract, which with ye said Mill on ye same, and all ye
utensils to ye said Mill belonging, together with all
other ye Buildings thereon. I have heretofore given
into ye possese!su of my son, Abraham Funck, and val-
ued to hiv, at £338, J say Three Hundred and Thirty-
eight Po.inds, yet so that J reserve to live thereon as
long as I will, or live. !

VIII. The payinents, for ye said plantation and for ye said
Mill and Land, sha!! be payable in one and ye same
manner: First,—After my decease, ye said Christian
Funck shall pay unto ye said Esther, ye interest of Two
Hundred Pounds, yet only at four per cent.—In like
manner, ye said Abraham Funck shall pay ye same of
Two Hundred Pounds at four per cent. And then ye
said Christian Funck shall on ye first May Fair or Fall
ffair, next after my decease which first happens, pay of
ye principal sum, ye sum of £25, I say Twenty-five
Pounds, In like manner, Abraham Funck shall pay ye
same sum: and go they are to continue respectively to
pay every year until ye whole is paid, And wien
Esther's monies are so paid off, then my Executczs may
put ye same out into trusty hands on interest; and if.
to my children, then take only four per cent thereon,

’ But if my Executors for want of trusty hands can’t put
out ye said monies, then. my Executors shall not be
lable to account for any Interest thereof, and when
Esther is departed this life, my children are to pay no
further Interest thereof, but pay ye principal sum as
is justly due, ,

IX. There shall no Vendue be held by reason of uneasi-
ness, and my moveable goods, my heirs may sell and
divide amongst themselves as well as they can. And
as relating my outstanding debts, they shall be col-
lected in manner as I have done hitherto, so as not to
sue any person for it. But whatever is or shall be
deemed as lost, may be lost, and my heirs shall leave
all such bad debts uncollected, as I hope the Divine

Blessing will make it up to them another way, which
article I would not have neglected.

X. It is also my ezrnest will, that immediately after my
decease and burial, £5, I say Five Pounds Current
Money shall be paid into ye Alms box of and for ye
Congregation aforesaid (named ye Mennonists),
amongst whom I served a long time in ye Ministry.
And likewise, as in thankfulness to ye Lord: If ye said
Esther should, by Divine favor, be enabled to walk,
or in case and when she in her present indigent state
is called by the Lord, by death, to go out of ye misery
of this world to Eternal rest; at ye fulfilling of either
of which cases, when the said Esther is delivered from
her present life of misery, the sum of £10, I say Ten
Pounds shall then immediately, without any evasion,
be paid out of ye said Estate into ye Alms of ye Con-
gregation aforesaid. .

XI. After due partition is made unto every one of his In-
heritance and Legacy, as is in this my Will contained
and is deducted out of my Estate, it is my will that ye
remainder of what name soever, be it moveable Goods
or Money, or outstanding Debts; as also, what my mar-
ried children have heretofore received and is put down
in writing, in my book for that purpose, stall be reck-
oned together, And that shall all be in Equal parts
divided amonget my Nine Children; namely: my sons,
John, Henry, Christian and Abraham Funck; and my
daughters, namely: Barbara, Anne, Mary, Fronicka
and Elizabeth Funck. But such of them as have here-
tofore received a good deal, shall not receive anything
unt{l such as have had less are Equal with them. So
that my said Nine Children’s sharés shall all be equal;
and such as have received too much, shall refund in
Proportion aforesaid,

* XII. As the Land whereon Jacob Bare now lives, I pur-
chased of Ebenezer Kinnesly, of whom I have a Deed
for the same, and I gave him bonds for ye money, so
that I have to this time paid for the said Land inclusive
of ye Charges and ye Interests gradually accruing
thereon, a sum of £84, I say Eighty-four Pounds, 3
Shillings and 5 Pence, Besides for ye same Land, the
sum of £50, I say Fifty Pounds is due by a Bond unto
Dirk Johnson. Now if ye said Jacob Bare or his heirs

s


============================================================

============================================================

— 18 —

do pay ye said debts for ye said Land; then my -Execu-
tora shall give him my Deed for ye said Land, with all
my right therein, to hold to him, his heirs and assigns,
and also for ye same, make and execute a Deed unto
him (out of.ye said Deed), which shall be deemed as
valid as if I, myself, had acted therein: But in case my
Executors and heirs are obliged to pay ye said debt for
ye said Land, then they shall have power to sell a part
of ye said Land, and make a title as aforesaid to ye
purchaser for ye same, in order ta reimburse them-
-selves of ye said Debt for ye said Land; and then leave
all ye remainder of ye said Land to. ye said Jacob or
his heirs, and in such case make him a deed for such
remainder of the said Land only in manner aforesaid,

XIII, And as I have also purchased’a tract of Land of 166
acres of ye Mannor Lands, on ye upper part of a branch
of Perckyoming, for £160, I say One Hundred and Sixty
Pounds, and I have paid for ye said. Land, and have a
Deed for, ye same, which said Land my son Henry
Funck shall have to him, his heirs and assigns; but as
I have been at. sundry charges of making ye deed, of
making improvements on ye said Land, and paying for
Nails, &c., all which together, whatsoever ye same
may be, I do totally estimate at £180, I say One Hun-
dred and Eighty Pounds to be paid for ye same after
my decease, in certain. terms of payment, to-wit; On
ye first ensuing Fall Fair, £10, 1 say Ten Pounds; the
second Fall ffair, £15, I say fifteen Pounds; and so on
every Fall ffair, £15, until ye whole is paid off: but if
any of ye said payment remains unpaid at ye time ap-
pointed, ye same shall, thenceforth, pay Interest for
ye maintenance of ye said Esther—but after ye decease
of the said Esther, no Interest shall be paid by my heirs
for their said payments, .

XIV. It isalso my will and order that soon as conveniently
may be done after my decease, my sons, Henry, Chris-
tian and Abraham Funck, shall have Deeds for their
Lands herein given unto them respectively, out of my
Patent and Deeds for ye same, together with all my
Right I haye therein, to hold to them, their heirs and
assigns, which Deeds, my four sons shall Execute and
make unto each other; which shall be as good and valid
as if I, myself, were acting therein. But if any of


============================================================

— 19 —

these, my said sons, shoyld happen to die before the
same is accomplished, and leaves heirs of his body,
then ye Executors of such, so deceased, shall join with
my other sons aforesaid in ye Execution of ye said
Deeds, which shall then be also as good and valid as if
such, my deceased son, had done it himself. But if any
one of them should behave himself. disobediently to
these Presents, then such as are obedient thereto, shall
Execute ye said Deeds, which shall then stand and be
as good as if I had done it myself, And none other of
my heirs shall henceforth have any claim to any of ye
said tracts of Land whatsoever. And it is also my fur-
ther will that at ye Execution and delivery of ye afore-
said Deeds, the owners of ye Lands therein contained as
aforesaid, shall then respectively give Security in
obligatory writings unto my Executors, that they re-
spectively will pay in lawful money the aforesaid con-
sideration sums for ye same Lands, as is herein before
ordained by this Will. .

XV. And I do hereby appoint my two sons, John Funck

and Christian Funck, to be my Executors, and fully Em-
powered to act agreeable hereto relating to my whole
estate, and as Co-heirs to superintend ye whole manage-
ment in manner aforesaid; and more especially relating
to my beloved, lame daughter, Esther, and her Estate;
in hopes they will willingly act ye just part towards any
one as much as is in their power, as is hereinbefore di-
rected; and as it is not my will that my Executors shall
suffer any demand by acting herein, yet it is not my will
nor mind that my Executors shall take ten per cent. of
ye whole for their service of their Brethren and Sisters;
but that for whatever time my Executors shall spend
and be at more Charges than my other heirs, an ade-
quate Satisfaction, according to Christian Equity shall

Mr, Funk moved to Chester Twp., Wayne Co., Ohio in
1826, where he built a “Mennonite church” on his land at
Chester Crossroads and preached for them several years
whey acontention arose among the members saying, he
preached too much like the “Methodists.” So the minor-
ity withdrew, but could not get the ‘‘church,” as he had
built {t on hisown land. Mr. Funk continued to preach
for the remaining members until Rev, John Winebrenner,
founder of the “Church of God," and his two missionaries,
Rev. Jacob Keller and Rev. Thomas Hickernell, came
through there, and Mr, Funk invited them to hold a
“protracted meeting” and thereby gained many con-
verts, They then organized a “Church of God,” Mr.
Funk and his members joining the church. Mr. Funk
was ordained elder, and continued preaching at Chester
Crossroads and neighboring churches for several years.
In-1849, he moved to Wooster, Ohio, where he lived until
hedied. .

for the <Atlunta (Georgia) Gazette and several other pa-
pers. The last year of his life was spent at home with his
parents, when he invented a “ Parlor and Ice Scate Com-
bined,” which he had patented. Several capitalists vis-
ited him and endeavored to purchase the right, but he
did not wish to sell. The scate is simply constructed,
and experiments have proven it to be an article that
would command a ready sale, had he lived several years
longer and placed it on the market. The patent papers
were received only a short time before his death, for
which reason it has not been manufactured and placed on
the market.

As a writer he assumed the name of ‘Ed. P. Cleon.”
Among his writings are two poems, one dedicated to Gov.
Drew, of Flurida, who was one of his intimate friends, and
A Satire on Ministers of Church and State, both of which

Deciding a nation’s fate, if not, decides thy own,
Showing the world her peuple once more free,
And by so doing, rending louse the very chains
That barred her golden gates, depriving immigration,
Mark her with homes, at which she dearly aims,
And keeping her the last among the nation.

And now let the bright angel of triumph sound
The glorious news, both far and wide;

Let snow-flakes sing it, as they fly to meet the ground,
And comets tell it-in their wondrous pride.

Yes; let it be echoed o’er the bridge of sighs;
Let the meteor reflect it to the worlds afar;

Let it ride on the mist, from the seas to the skies
That the golden gates of Florida now stand ajar.

Here emigrants may clasp a welcoming hand,
Be they from North, South, England or Ireland hurl’d,
We ask—beseech them to come, join our band,
For Florida, yet, will be the Eden of the world.
Here are the flelds, uncultured and unclaimed,
Like other fertile lands, awaiting for the plow;
And in this centennial year the gates have been un-
. chained, °
Yet few shall know they ever were one hundred years
from now.

MINISTERS OF CHURCH AND STATE,
(A SATIRE.)
BY CLEM, PURDY,

Awake! Ye Ministers of State and Church—
Wash from your heart and eyes the smirch;
Study your duties, be to them confined—

Too many irons will séar or scorch the mind.
Let reason rule, and fools alone cry bosh,
Because the paper of satire won't wash!

Where are the minds, with reason given,
Which actuate the soul to love and Heaven?
Are they alone among the clergy found?

And are their minds alone the sound ?

Fool ! he who thinks their reasoning more true
Than he who expounds on a drop of dew,—
Interprets earth, exposiug to our view

Ita hidden layers, and their meaning, too.

Vain, shattered mite, is he who dares to mix
Sacred religious duties with irreligious tricks:
They will not blend, the difference is too great—
Sacred religion rules the soul, not State!

True, if the Ministers of State be true,
Our laws will be,—their administration, too,
But true men, like bad, are born to die;
They fill this, that, position with a sigh—
Then pass away, their place to be soon filled
By him whose art in cunning is most skilled,

Contemptuous politician, what is thy gain

But honor, reaped from out a world’s disdain ?
Oh, meddling clergy! this but makes it worse,
What causes you, grasp such reward, the purse!

Still stand at bay, don’t jest my song to scorn,
Remember truth oft pierces like a thorn;
But tell me this: thy duty since ordained ?
Not that I wish to see thee more enchained,
But that by reason I may fully show
That thieves of duty won't to Heaven go.
Should all the farmers in this land of ours,
Cultivate but roses and such-like flowers,
‘Twould not be long before we'd cry for bread—
’Twould not be long before we'd all be dead.
Or should the rulers of our States turn seamen,
What barbarism would befall the god Hymen?
Alas! should clergy seek to rule the State,
What creed would most predominate ?
Pre-eminence in creed cannot be found—

Nach claims its own to be most true, most sound.
Most Reverend Sir, since you don’t wish to rule,
Why, like a school-boy, in debate at school,

®xpound on things which you have only read
With no more understanding in your head
Than he, who says that Heaven’s color’s blue ?

Ask how he knows, he’s seen and read so, too.
Perchance he learns that air by distance grows

As blue as indigo—his former knowledge goes;
Thus he is left more wiser than before —
Atmospheric blue is not fren (1) Heaven’s floor.
Thus, subjects, questions, themes which do arise
Require most cogent reasoning. from the wise—
Months of hard study, in their field of labor spent,
Is all that makes their knowledge worth a cent. .
Acknowledge this, for it is Heaven’s law

That knowledge grows, just like the grain in straw.

Since knowledge grows and you have been ordained,
Is not your duty here, in life, explained? .
Mark well my words, for he who studies law
Can't set the bones or patch a fractured jaw;

(1)—The word “ fren’! means foreign,


============================================================
PAGE 47
============================================================

Can he who expounds God’s most Holy Word

Find time to study politics? Absurd!

Then why, ye softs, why try to interpose

Duties, which each the other will transpose.
Amend your course, let reason guide your sail
Instead of passion, with its wrecking gale,

And thus good morals to hufnanity instill ;

Fill heart and soul with God, and love, good will:
Let politics and all the minor duties go—
There're other men to study them you know.

Each has his work—yours is of most import

For it all other duties does support.

Thus steal not from the time which God has given,
But prepare as many souls as possible for Heaven !

died when he was but eight months old, and he was then
taken by his Grandfather Abraham Funck, with whom he
lived until he was three years old. His oldest sister Mary
would often come over to see her little baby brother for
whom she had formed a warm maternal-like attachment.
One day, when about to return to her father’s house after
one of these visits, she managed to get the little fellow
away from the old people without their noticing that she
had gone off with him, and gaining strength and courage
from her success, she actually carried him off to her
father’s home, from whence no amount of persuasion or
threats could induce her to let him go, and therefore he
remained with his father. He was by nature studious
and at the age of nineteen he graduated from the Fiud-
lay Schools (Normal Dept.) The. next two years he
spent in teaching school in Findlay, O., at the end of
which time he became of age, and then, like other young
men, took Horace Greeley’s advice and went west in the
spring of 1882 to the state some call the ‘Italy of Amer-
ica,” locating at Hutchinson, Kan. Six miles west of
this promising city he ‘took up a Homestead,” working
on his “Claim” in the summer, and teaching school in

law, which profession he had determined to adopt as the
hope of his future. In 1883 he was married to Mary, the
accomplished daughter of Enoch C, Marks, a prosperous
farmer and stockman, of Reno Co., Kan. In Jan,, 1889,
Mr. Shuler proved up on his claim, and on St. Valentine's
day, 1889, he sold off all his personal effects, and started
for his boyhood home, Findlay, Ohio, on Washington's
birthday, Feb. 22, 1889, where he intended to complete his
law reading and be admitted to the practice of his profes-
sion under the laws of the state of Ohio, A year and six
months were spent in further preparation, and in June,
1890, he was admitted to the bar by the Supreme Court of
Ohio, and immediately began the practice of the profes-
sion, to attain which he had labored diligently for eight
years, He purchased a little home for himself and family
in Findlay, and no doubt has permanently located there,

er. Menn, Children: Jacob, Abraham, Albert, Hor-
ace, Mary. The death of Mrs, Heebner by drowning was
a very sad occurrence, and took place on Sunday, May 15,
1898. At about 11 o'clock Mr, and Mrs. Heebner and their
five children, and Allen, son of Cyrus Clemmer, of Hat-
field, in a covered express wagon left the Heebner home
to visit Mre, Heebner’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jacob 8,
Landes, a short distance north of Maialand. Ase they ap-
proached the crossing of the Skippack creek Mr. Heebner
saw that the bridge was entirely covered and surrounded
by water. His horse did not waut to follow the roadway
to the bridge, but Mr. Heebner urged him on, At the
same time Mrs, Heebner urged her husband to go ahead,
she being well acquainted with the creek and the cross-
ing at that point. As the bridge was reached Mr. Heeb-
ner tried to guide the horse to the left, but could not.

There being no railing on the upper side, there was no
means of telling how near the edge was, and the next in-
stant the horse went off the bridge into the rushing
waters. Mr. and Mrs, Heebner and their daughter Mary
were thrown headlong into the stream. The horse tore
out of the shafts and was carried by the current under
the bridge, as was also Mrs, Heebner and the little child
which she held, and this was the last seen of them alive.
Mr. Heebner managed to get hold of a wheel of the
wagon and saved himself. Horace, one of the boys, made
an opening in the rear cover of the wagon and got out on
the bridge, the other boys also managed to get out on the
bridge and safe to land, and the horse also reached the
shore, but the wife and child had entirely disappeared,,
By this time a number of people had hurried to the scene
and search at once began for the bodies of the drowned
mother and child, which was kept up until night, The
stream as far as Mainland was thoroughly searched.
About 7 o’clock Benjamin A. and Sheridan A. Metz found
the body of the child washed upon some brush along the
bank below the residence of J. C. Landis, They took
the body to the home of Mr. Landis, Early on Mon-
day morning search began for the body of the woman by
a large number of people. By noon nearly 300 people
were counted along the creek at Mainland. Several
boats with men and poles went down stream for two
miles carefully searching every foot of ground without
success. They, however, had passed the body, which was
found by Henry G. Metz at a quarter to one o'clock
lodged along the bank near the residence of Isaiah
Garges, completely covered with brush and rubbish, It
lay about a hundred yards farther down than where the
child was found. The body was removed to the yard of
Mr. Gargés. It had lain in the water 26 hours, Benjamin
A, Metz couveyed the body to the desolate home where
the sorrowing husband and relatives were in waiting and
relieved to know that the body had been recovered. The
child's age was 2 years, 10 months and 27 days. The
mother’s, 30 years, 6 months and 2 days. At the double
funeral an immense concourse of people were in attend.
ance, from 1200 to 1600, Interment at the Plain Menno-
nite meeting house. Revs, Jacob E. Moyer, Christian
Allebach, Jonas Mininger, H, 8, Bower, Michael Moyer
and Josiah Clemmer conducted the services,

and orothers, would attend the country public schools,
whiie in the summer he would do—well—the work
cf an honest, industrious farmer boy. At school, not-
withstanding the meagre facilities for mental discipline
then to be had, he made a record for improvement and
progressiveness which even at that early period presaged
the career that afterwards followed. Whenonthe farm,
although he aspired to different pursuits, yet he went
about his work with that degree of energy and with that
spirit of earnestness which never fails to bring success,
Such were his early advantages, such the surroundings
and opportu: ities that helped strengthen and invigorate
lim for the active work of life. At the early age of
fifteen he started out to do for himself. Thus early in
llfe he started out to meet the world, and the world was
ready to receive him. The ctive and the faithful never
fall of their reward, Going to Valparaiso Ind., were
he still resides, in 1860, he took a clerkship in a dry roods
store, working hard and receiving small compensation for
his services. For four years he served in this capacity,
and during that time by his manliness, deportment and
business tact, he won the fullest confidence, not only of his
employer but of his associates and the general public as
well, But during these yeara the great civil conflict was
raging. Deluged in blood, the giant powers of the North
and South were arrayed against each other and spending
their deadly force. It was then, loyal to the institutions
of his country and true to the promptings of his heart,
that he gave up his position and went forth In the great
struggle for right. He enlisted with Co, C, 188th Indiana
Vol., May 26, 1864, serving in the Army of the Cum-
berland which campaigned through middle Tennessee and
Alabama, Wherever duty called, there was he ever
ready to respond; and for unfaltering courage and stead-
fastness was he known alike to his comrades and super-
lors, each of whom found in him a cheering companion
and friend. He was discharged with the rank of corporal
Oct. 5, 1864. Returning to Valparaiso in 1866, he again
engaged in the capacity of a clerk, but this time with a
hardware establishment. So faithful was he in the ser-
vice of his employer that after a five years’ engagement
he was admitted to a partnership, The business of the
partners prospered, and for over two decades by wise

management, judicious and honest dealings with the
people, their enterprise gradually assumed larger propor
tions, In 1892, Col. Haste purchased his partner's interest
in the concern, thereby assuming entire ownership and
control. Thus he advanced step by step froma clerkship
to the head of one of the largest business enterprises in
his city, It isan example of prosperous growth, of activ-
ity and thrift well worthy of emulation. Col, Haste not
only stands as sole owner of a large and prosperous es..
tablishment, but has other interests as well. He has;,
lovely home which is presided over by a devoted wife. Iu
short, he is one of the city’s substantial and most es-
teemed citizens, In 1882 he enlisted in the state militia
and served three years as Captain of Company C, 3rd
Regiment Infantry Indiana Legion, From this rank he
was promoted to that of Battalion Major, serving in this
capacity for two years. He afterwards served as Regi-
mental Major two years and was then again promoted to
the rank of Colonel, which office he held for three years,
In each of these positions he displayed rare military skill
and he discharged hie official duties with that degree of
credit that has been so characteristic of the acts of his
Nfe. His military record, no less than his record as a
citizen, stamps him as a man of superb courage, of moral
strength, and asa man who is unwilling to remain idle
when there is 2 higher plane to be reached, Early in life
he united with the Methodist Episcopal church, of which
he has always been an active member and his influence
for good has never ceased to be felt, He isa member of
the Knights of Pythias and served four years as Lieuten-
ant Colonel of the uniformed rank. His voice is also
heard in the councile of the Masonic order to which he is
a conservative and valued adherent, Although he has
just rounded out his fiftieth year, yet his physical condi-
tion gives promise of many useful years to come, By per-
severance, diligence and indomitable energy he has
pushed himself forward from the unknown unaided boy to
the full dignity of matured manhood surrounded by affiu-
ence honorably acquired, and more than all he has won
for himself a name of spotless and unquestioned

integrity.

School at Valparaiso, graduating in 1878, The years 1879
and 1880 he spent teaching in Illinois, During the latter
year he was elected president of the Kansas State Nor-
mal School at Concordia, Kan., which position he resigned
' to accept the principalship of the Streater High School,
Streator, Ill, Here he remained two years, when he en-
tered the Law School of the University of Michigan at
Ann Arhor, completing the law course in 1885, He im-
mediately located in Wichita, Kan., in the practice of
law. The great boom of 1896 and 1887 enabled hin to
amass quite a fortune (some #40,000) in real estate specu-
lations which was duly lost in the following reaction, In
1887 he was married to Sarah Atherton. During the year
1887 he was elected professor of law in the Garfield Uni-
versity, which position he held until his removal to West
Superior, Wis., in 1891, since which time he has been en-
gaged in the practice of law at that place. He has never
held any public office. His only experience in politics
was in Kansas where he ran for the Legislature on the
Republican ticket in 1888 and was defeated. Mz. Haste
has also some local reputation as a writer of fiction and
poetry. He isthe author of a political drama, in three
parts, entitled ‘To the Victor Belong the Spoils,” which
has been published in pamphlet form, and some after din-
ner poems that have also been published, and which speak
well of his ability as a writer. He has also’a work of fic-
tion under way, but which will not be ready for publica-
tion for about two years yet. One child.

miller in the Maitland Valley Roller Mills, of Listowel,
Perth county, Ont., Canada. In 1888 the firm increased
their business by purchasing the Victoria Roller Mills, of
Palmerton, Mr, Meyers was left in control of the for-
mer, and his partner assumed control of the latter. The
water works of the town of Listowel also belong to Mr.
Meyers, and have been operated by him since'1891. As
he and his son Josephus buy all kinds of grain, they pur-
chased in 1892 a large elevator in Listowel, and further
increased their business by leasing in 1804 the Oatmeal
Mills of Palmerton, with the privilege of buying. Be-
sides carrying on his own private enterprises, Mr. Meyers
has always been identified with matters pertaining dl-
rectly to the public. While living on his farm he was for
some time a member of the township council, and later
of the Listowel council, until he accepted the contract to
furnish the town with water. He is a member of the
High School Board, of the board of directors of the
Morris-Field-Rogers Piano Company, and president of the
board of Public Library of the same town. Methodist.

THREE SCORE,

Full three score miles my journey on
Have I been traveling now,

From Tropic isles and sunny skies
To Arctic hills of snow,

How many miles amorg these hills
My journey yet may be,

Until I can no farther g0,
Is quite unknown to me.

My pilgrimage in all this land,

Through dark and thorny vales,
, Has often been on barren sand

In strong tempestuous gales,

With cloudy skies and thunderstorms
Thick gathering overhead, .

And threatening me with false alarms,
With danger, fear and dread.


============================================================

Like winter on the Arctic hills

The frosts are on my brow,
: Which seems to bring November chills

Through all my being now.

My vision fails me where’er I be
In this Autumnal haze,

The winter is awaiting me,
The winter of my days.

Ihave a home beyond these hills

Which I have never seen,

A home where neither frosts nor chills

Disturb the smiling green.

They say the street is paved with gold,

The mansion large and fair,

And that the people, young and old,

Are very happy there.

Mr. Heckler was reared on a farm and received but a
limited education. In arithmetic, however, he was
pretty good, and at the age of 17 was admitted into Cas-
sel's store at Harleysville as clerk. In January, 1854,
Mr. Heckler was admitted as a partner in said store
where he remained until 1861, when he withdrew from
the store and went into the tobacco business, which
eventually proved a failure. About the year 1871, Mr.
Heckler removed with his family to Rock Creek, twelve
miles west of Sterling, Ill, and a year or two later to
Mount Carroll, same state, where he was called to the
ministry about the year 1874. For several years after
moving weat he engaged in farming, but afterwards
served as clerk in a store at Mount Carroll, Ill., for four
or five years, when he removed his family to Nebraska,
where they purchased a farm, which after farming for
several years, they rented out and came east, spending
about six months visiting friends and relatives, after
which they returned west to Mount Carroll, Ill, and kept
store for a year or two, and then sold out and returned
to their farm near Elmwood, Cass Co., Neb. In the
meantime his boys grew up and went into business for
themselves, and having many calls to preach, which
made it impossible for him to run his farm himeelf,
others performed that service for him until 1894, when he
rented his farm out and moved to Alvo, a small place in
the same county, and devotes all his time to the minis-
try. Mr. Heckler belongs to the German Baptist church
and has been appointed or employed by the Missionary
Board to fill those many calls for preaching and to organ-

they moved to Lancaster Co., Pa., where his brother,
Henry, was already living, and some time later the
brothers changed residences, Michael and his family
moved into the house formerly occupied by Henry, the
latter having built himself a new house. While Michael
lived in the former home of his brother Henry, one of
their cats got into the habit’ of climbing up the fire cor-
ner into an open place in the wall where she would sit
and whine; 80 one day his wife told Michael to get that
cat down that was always sitting there and whining, and
Michael in trying to.get the cat, got hold of a bag of
money, containing one hundred dollars, after which the
cat came down of her own accord and never went up
again. Michael went to see Henry about the money. At
first he did not recollect that he had: ever put any money
up there, but thought because he had formerly lived in
the house he ought to have. the half of it. Michael. was
sure it was not his money and the longer Henry consid-
ered the matter the more did he think it was all his, espec-
jally when he saw the bag, which he thought he recog-
, nized as having been his and, therefore, he claimed all of
the money, but gave Michael $5.00 for his honesty. Other
people thought it belonged to Michael more than to

DESCENDANTS OF HENRY FUNK, SON OF
BISHOP HENRY FUNCK,

i. Henry Funk, bn. in Montg. Co., Pa., —-; died in
Rockingham Co., Virginia, ——, Mrd. Barbara Showalter,
Henry Funk inherited the farm of 166 acres that his
father purchased ‘of ye Mannor Lands on ye upper part
of a branch of Perckyoming.” Just where this farm was
located is not known, but was no doubt some where in
Bucks county, probably in New Britain township. As
there is on record at Doylestown that letters of adminis-

24, 1783, who Probably was the son of Bishop Henry Funck.
In 1786 he with all his family, except his eldest son Jacob,
moved to Virginia, where he lived, prospered and died.
From the following letter of Col. Daniel Hiester, Jr., to
Dr. Joseph Gardner, member of the Council of Skippack
Twp., furnished by James y, Heckler, it is found that
Henry Funk had also been a minister among the Menno-
nites for many ‘years, but on account of his having
taken the “test of State,” was excluded from the Society,
in like manner and for the same reason as was his brother
Rev. Christian Funk, After which he seems to have con-
tinued to preach tn connection with his brother, Rev,
Christian Funk, to the people known as the Funkites,
until his removal to Virginia,

HATFIELD, Pa., Sept. 2, 1895,
Rav. J. PF, Funk, Editor and Publisher,
As you are publishing a history of the Funk family,
I send you the following letter which came under my
notice quite recently, It ought by all means to find a
place in your history. As it was written by Col. Hiester

at the time of the Revolutionary war, it shows to some
extent what delicate and perplexing questions some of
the officers had to deal with, and in this case also how
justly. J. Y. HECKLER.

OCTOBER 4th, 1781.

To DR. JOSEPH GARDNER, Member of Council, Skippack
Township:

Sir:—The bearer hereof, Mr. Henry Funck, is going
to Council with a complaint respecting a Demand of
Substitute Fines made on him by Frederick Limback,
Esqr., one of the Sub-Lientsof Northampton County. The
complaint, I confess, appears to me of a new Kind and
Mr. Funck states it thus, that he (Mr. Funck) is a
preacher and has been so for many years among the
people called Menonists, but having taken the test. of
State and done a great deal of Business for the publick
in the purchasing and milling way, was read out of that
society; and as be is not now acknowledged a preacher by
the Body of the society, Mr. Limback says he cannot con-
sider himself such, and consequently Fines him, for
neglect of duty in the militia, altho’ he favors many non-
jurer preachers of the same people, Mr. Funck can in-
form you more particularly of the circumstances, but I
know that he and his brother Christian Funck (a remark-
ably strong whig), are preaching to the few well affected
of that society; that he is a man of good character, (so
think there is no reason of reading him out of the
society, but his attachment to the cause of this country)
and that he has done much publick Business. Upon the
whole, I think it a new Doctrine that a man sho'd be un-
privileged hecause he is disowned by a people for his com-
plying with the Laws of his country, and beg you will be
Kind enough, if you find his complaint reasonable, to see
him justice done as far as possible,

Tam, with real Esteem, Sir,

Your very H’bl.
DANIEL HIESTER, JR.

Of the personal history of Henry Funk, the following
sketch has been furntshed by a grandson, Rev. Benjamin
Funk, of Singere Glen, Va.

‘Men are very prone at the present day to repeat
what was long ago sald, ‘If we had lived in the days of
our fathere, we would not have permitted their bones to
fall into their graves and buried out of sight, unmarked,
unnumbered and unsung.’ With but few exceptions,
however, the same may be said to the generation now
living that was said to the scribes and Pharisees, ‘As
your fathers did, sodo ye.’ But it is a matter of con-
gratulation that some are turning attention to family
genealogy. Whilst we lament the meagre and fragment-
ary character of the data, which, like the relics of up-
turned grave yards, lie strewn upon the ground or buried
beneath its surface, and which require great labor and
time to gather up, still perhaps enough may be found to
show in whose loins the members of the same great family
may have reposed one hundred and seventy years ago,

“The Funk family in America have sprung from an
ancestry whose lines are well marked as far as they can
be traced. These lines, however, are mainly found
within the limits of agricultural {udustry, genuine mor-
ality, and sincere earnestness in the performance of the
duties of the Christian religion, coupled with a firm faith
in its saving power. No fame of arms-bearing or military
skill has ever been attached to any bearing the name of
Funk, The records of American history, at least, are
silent, and know not the name. But other records are
also silent. The state prison of Virginia has never in-
carcerated a convict of the name of Funk belonging to
the line descended from the pioneer of the Virginia Val-
ley. But the records of the Christian church, especially of
that branch of it known as the Mennonite church, are
alive with the names of pioneers and heroes in the sev-
eral generations of Funke that have lived since the estab-
Nshment of the church in America. First and foremost
among these stands the name of Henry Funck, whom
fancy pictures as a tall man, having a large and well pro-
portioned frame, very muscular, with dark hair and eyes,
a face indicating great firmness and resolution, and a
body capable of. enduring great hardehips. How nearly
this fancied representation of him may correspond with
truth, cannot be said. But of this there {fs sure proof,
that he was a man of great mental and moral force.

“Hig German writings which his grandson Joseph
read much, and to which he often alluded in the presence
of his children as being the production of their great
grandfather, were eminently pious and full of love to
God and man.

“Of Henry Funck, of Indian Creek notoriety, whose .
memory is embalmed in the heart of Franconia township,
Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, nothing more need be
said, But stepping downward along the banks of “the
river of time,” we find a stone sacredly engraven to the
memory of his son Henry, the progenitor of the family in
the Virginia Valley. Of his early days little is known;
of his later life, when he had become the father of thir-
teen children whose names are well known, we are better
informed. .

“About fifty-two years ago his son Christian Funk
went to Pennsylvania to hunt up, if possible, some former
acquaintances and visit the old home. He found what he
sought. But few, however, of those whom he had known
in youth, were to be found; but in speaking of his trip
he mentioned having met some who were still re-
membered by relatives in Virginia, and he was especially
interested in telling about the: old homestead and the
mill owned by his grandfather.

“About the close of the Revolutionary war he dis-
posed of his property, and in the year 1786, he with all his
family removed to the Virginia Valley, except his eldest
gon Jacob, who remained in Pennsylvania. They settled
in Rockingham county, about. eight miles north of the

city of Harrisonburg.”

leader until his death, Before he passed away he had
the desire of his heart to see every one of his eight chil-
dren with their mother brought into the saving knowl-
edge of Jesus Christ as their Savior from sin, and so
passed away triumphantly into the heavenly, eternal
home. Children: Joseph, Caroline, Albert, Medora,

for the purpose, Already God has given a permanent
Home for this work at Collegepoint, L. I., where 46 are

many years, and was a great sufferer much of his life. In
1869 he very wonderfully escaped an awful death, While
engaged in removing an overshoot of a barn, the roof
tilted, and he with roof, plates, and all came to the
ground with a dreadful crash. Several men present with
baled faces hastened to his help, but to their great sur-
prise found him uninjured.

1882, when he took a trip East, and in June decided to try
the entrance examinations of Cornell University, at
Ithaca, N. Y. These he passed and in the following Sep-
tember he entered the University and passed up several
branches. - In the spring of 1883, he returned to Ransom,
IIL, to teach. He taught a year at Ransom, Ill, after
which he started East to finish his course of study. By
hard work and passing up by actual examinations some
branches in the course, he was able in two years more to
pass creditably on 200 hours of work while only 180 were
required for graduation, Hence in June, 1886, he gradu-
ated at Cornell University in the Scientific Course, in
Agriculture with honors, on his 108 paged Thesis. Upon
graduation he became principal of the high school and
graded school, of Tonic, Il, where he taught one year,
being then (1887) elected Professor of Botany and Horti-
culture of the State Agriculture and Mechanical College
of Texas, which he accepted at a salary of $1,200 per
year.. Here he remained three years with an increase of
salary to $1,500. He was then elected to fill the same
chair at the Maryland Agricultural College (1890), being
Horticulturist of the Agricultural Experiment Station
and Botanist and Horticulturist of the College. While in
Texas, he was editor, for a year, of the Southern Horlicul-
tural Journal, published at Dallas, Texas, and in which he
held an interest until it was eold to the American Garden,
of New York City, where it was merged into the American
Garden, of which he has for a time beenan Associate Editor,
Later he graduated in medicine and practiced his profes-
sion for two years in Chicago, Ill. He recently moved to
Dixon, Ill, where he is now an eye, ear, nose and throat
specialist. Meth. Ep, ch, South. -

walter’s New Harmony and Composition,” “Song-Land

with The Musical ‘Teacher, which he has edited for fifteen
years, and the many sessions of the Suuthern Normal
Musical Institute, of which Mr. Showalter has been
principal since its first session in 1880, have made the
name of this branch of the family a household word in
hundreds of thousands of homes in all sections of the
country, but especially so in the Southern and South-
western states. Among the many prominent pupils of
Mr. Showalter may be mentioned: his brother, J. Henry

vi. J. Henry Showalter, bo. at Cherry Grove, Rock-
ingham Co,, Va., Nov. 2, 1864. His distinctive life work,
to the present, has been that of singer, teacher, com-
poser and publisher of sacred music, And while he is a
hard worker all along the line of his profession, his
greatest delight is in singing sacred songs and he isa
singer of unusual power and sweetness. While tempor-
arily residing in East Tennessee, he was popularly known
as the “Sweet Singer of East Tennessee.” Born and
reared on the farm, he early learned the habits of indus-
try and they have never forsaken him in his professional
work, His parents being of strong religious.sentiments,
he early sought a religious life, and at the age of seven-
teen united with the German Baptist church of which
he is still an earnest member. His primary musical edu-
cation was received from his father, who was for many
years a prominent teacher of music. His voice closely
resembles that of his father’s, which is a high baritone
and very full of musical quality. His professional life
began when he was 19 years of age and has been a busy
one. In the year 1886 while pursuing his work in the
state of Ohio, he met and married Miss Emma, daughter
of J. H. and Margurette Brumbaugh, of Darke Co., Ohio,
since which time his home has been at West Milton, O.,
where he now has quite a successful publishing house.
He has been especially fortunate in having associated
with him in his business efforts, men of strong mind and
character, of whom we would mention Rev, J. H. now,
of Knoxville, Tenn.; Judge John P. Davis, of Rome, Ga.;
Rev. and Prof. E, S. Young, of North Manchester, Ind.;
Prof. Geo. B. Holsinger, of Bridgewater, Va., and Prof.
S. J. Perry, of Dalton, Ga., etc.

While he has been very busy teaching and singing,
as well as looking after his publishing business, he has
found time to edit a number of books, viz., “Vocal Music
Reader,” issued in 1889, ‘Choice Chorus Collection,”
issued in 1890, ‘‘Regal Singer,” issued in 1891,

‘Pgalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, No. 1,” issued in
1892, No. 2 of last named collection, in 1895. ‘‘Showal-
ter’s Vocal Studies,” in 1896, ‘Psalms, Hymus and Spirit-
ual Songs, No. 3,” along with P., H. andS. 8., Nos. 1,2
and 3, combined, in 1897, The last named collection has
become a great favorite among church and Sunday school
workers and about 70,000 copies have been sold and ere
the present year (1898) is gone, will have reached the
100,000 mark. Such under the blessings of God has been
and is the life and labor of a young country boy who at
present is engaged ina very successful season of normal
work in the state of Alabama. No issue.

I. Susanna Funk, daughter of Henry Funk, was born
Oct. 30, 1775. Married George Beery. During the latter
part of her life she took much interest in her grandchil-
dren and related to them many incidents of her early
Nfe, Among others were the following which were given
by her grandson, George W. Beery. Her father, Henry
Funk, was pressed into the service during the War of Ia-
dependence, to do transportation service with his team.


============================================================
PAGE 260
============================================================

The farmers in the eastern states at that time did their
heavy hauling with four horses. He was very reluctant
to accept this service and assist the army in this war.
Finally Susanna said she would go with him and rode the
saddle horse. «As they were driving along a cannon ball
struck the two horses on the lead, killlng them both.
This so shocked the father that he immediately deter-
mined to leave the service and go home, saying that
he would refuse further service whatever the result
might be.

In the vicinity where they lived, the Indians were
still numerous ani to some extent dangerous, The chief
of the tribe was a very good friend of the family and told
her father to watch his wigwam and whenever he should
see no smoke ijesuing from it that they might know that
there was trouble and to get themselves away. One
morning after they had risen they noticed that there was
no smoke from the wigwam of the chief. They took their
horses and gathered together what they could and left
the place, Thatsame day the Indians started out on
the warpath and destroyed everything that came in
their way.

¥. Rev. John M. Brenneman, born in Fairfield Co.

Good, June 1837, Minister and bishop of the Mennonite
church. Children: Joseph, Susanna, Lydia, Anna,
Henry, Moses, Manasseh, Catharine, Levi, George, Eliza-
beth, Magdalena. He with his wife united with the
Mennonite church in Fairfield Co., Ohio, shortly after
their marriage. In April 1844 he was chosen and or-
dained to the ministry of the Gospel. In the fall of 1848
he moved to Franklin County, where he resided a little
over six years, and then in the spring of 1855 he moved to


============================================================
PAGE 261
============================================================

— 236 —

Allen Co., where he resided to the time of his death. In
1849 he was ordained to the office of bishop in Franklin
County.

He was the father of twelve children, six sons and
six daughters, of whom elght, three sons and five
daughters survived him, ‘There were also forty-five
grandchildren of whom thirty-seven survived; and twen-
ty-seven great-grandchildren of whom twenty-five sur-
vived,

He was an earnest, zealous laborer in the vineyard of
the Lord, and the great purpose and concern of his life
was the welfare and prosperity of the church which he
loved, and the salvation of souls. He always was espe-
cially concerned for the salvation of his own children
and grandchildren, So marked was his desire in this di-
rection that even during the prime of his life he gave
very little attention to his temporal affairs, but spent
most of his time in the work to which the Master had
called him and in the study of the Scriptures. During
hig last illness, he very frequently desired devotional ex-
ercises, and asked those who came to visit to pray with
him, and on one occasion he desired that the prayer
might be especially for the salvation of hls children and
grandchildren; and when his grandchildren came to
see him, he would take them by the hand and admon-
ish them to be good, or ask them if they would not be
good, and often held them by the hand until they prom-
ised they would,

His disposition was to look rather on the dark
than on the bright side of things—rather to the sertous
and solemn than to the enjoyable or glad aspect
of things; and from this fact he often suffered intense
grief and sadness of heart. Aftlictions seemed to take so
deep a hold on his mind, that sometimes it seemed as
though they were too heavy for him to bear. When he
saw members of the church becoming unfaithful, it
caused him intense grief, and he would with tears plead
with them, and try to win them back. When troubles
and dissensions came up in the church, he was often
greatly troubled and those who shared with him the flery
trials of the past forty-five years in the church well know
of the tears he shed and the sorrows which he endured

on account of the church and the part which those he
dearly loved took in them,

One of the great afilictions of his life was the sudden
death of his son Henry, who was instantly killed by light-
ning, during a thunder-storm, on August 28, 1872. His
wife Sophia died thirteen years before he was called to
his eternal rest. ‘This also caused him great sorrow, but
putting his trust in the Lord, he looked forward in an
abiding hope—vea, as he said on two occasions during his
last illness in a Hving hope, “Kine Lebendige Hoffnung.”

About twenty years before he died he became subject
to an affection of a paralytic nature and which gradually
grew on him until it disabled him altogether for the
work in which he was so deeply interested. During his
last years he was very feeble in body, so that he could
seldom even go to meeting, but his mind was strong and
vigurous to the end. His last sickness was first malarial
fever, of which he suffered about four weeks, During
the last week of his life the disease turned to irritation
of the bowels, He suffered patiently and without a mur-
mur until death came to his relief,

On the morning before his death he requested tohave
sung the hymn, ‘Abide with me, fast falls the eventide,”
etc, A week before he died he was impressed with the
thought that his end was near and requested that his
daughter Annie should be sent for, made arrangements
for his burial, and who should conduct the services, and
named some of the hymns to be used, and especially re-
quested that he should be buried in a quiet way without
pomp or display, and without eulogy, so as not to give
anyone the idea that he could be saved by good works,
but alone through grace as the free glft of God.

His funeral services were held at the Salem meeting
house on the Sth of October. His funeral was largely
attended. The services were conducted by Bish, J, F,
Funk, of Elkhart, Indiana, from the text, Deut. 6:29,
which he himself had selected for the occasion some
years ago. He was not only an earnest preacher, but
also a diligent writer. He wrote a great many able and
edifying articles in the Herald of Truth, His first
work was the little book “Christianity and War,” pub-
lished in 1863 which has passed through several editions,


============================================================

At the communion season in the spring of 1895 he
was unable to attend the public services, but desired that
the communion be given him at his home, This was
done and was such a source of comfort to him that he
shed tears of joy on the occasion.

“Plain Teachings,” an excellent collection of his best
articles, {acluding several hymns, was published In 1876.

Thus, both by preaching and writing, did he seek to
do his Master's work and labor for the promotion of the
cause, Fora time he felt that he wanted to stay, that
he might still be a comforter and an advisor to his chil-
dren and their descendants. But before he died he could

many children and young persons, many of whom had

never seen him personally. He was a great friend to the
children and so great was his interest in them that
almost every boy and girl he met on the street or in the
country expected a kind word from him. He labored
earnestly in the Sunday school, and regularly taught a
class uf boys till within a few weeks of his death, Their
teacher is gone, but may his instructions in which he so
often pointed them to Jesus live in their hearts, and
obeying them may they so live that they may meet their
teacher in heaven where he so often longed to be. He
frequently gave earnest and instructive admonitions in
the church services. About four or five years before his
death he composed a beautiful hymn and set it to music.
While this was being sung at his funeral service almost
every oue present was affected to tears. May we not
hope that he has now gone to that ‘Home of the Blest’””
and now realizes the closing words of his hymn.

‘When we get to that Home of the Blest,
From all pain to be free,

And with Jesus forever to rest,
Oh, how sweet it will be!

CxHo.—Oh, that beautiful, beautiful land,
Is for you and for me!

There to be with the glorified band,
Oh, how sweet it will be!”

and a natural arithmetician, being able to:compute men-
tally the most difficult problems more quickly and more
accurately than when computed by others with paper
and pencil, He was of more than ordinary intelligence:
He was a member of the Mennonite church, being
a faithful deacon in that denomination for many
years. During all of his many and important busi-
ness transactlons he never endorsed another's note,
neither did he ever ask for an endorsement save
once, and then for the small amount of three dollars,

not prosper so far as this world is concerned, Frequently
unable to own a horse, he would travel on foot to his ap
pointments to preach. He died very poor, leaving noth-
ing for his orphan children but the memories of his holy
life and pious example. About six months before his

vive him, 1878, While the subject of our sketch was yet
quite young, his parents with their family emigrated to
Fairfield Co., Ohio. Here he grew up to manhood’s years
and in 1835, when he was about nineteen years of age, he
was united in matrimony with Nancy Blosser, who
also resided in Fairfield county, and was then only a little
past sixteen years of age. Ghe wae the daughter of
Tsaac and Elizabeth Blosser, who had a family of four-
teen children.

A few years after their marriage he and his wife
poth united with the Mennonite church, of which they
remained consistent members to the time of their death.
In 1838 they moved to Hocking Co., Ohio, and in 1852 they
removed again from Hocking Co., Ohio, to Franklin Co.
Here, in the same year, he was chosen by the church to
the office of deacon, in which office he served the church |
until he was called to the ministry.

In 1855 he removed to Allen Co., and resided there
until August, 1865, when he removed to Branch Co., Mich,
where, with the exception of a little leas than a year, he
spent the remainder of his life. ;

Inasmall memorandum book found among his effects
we find over his own signature the following record, ‘In
Branch Co. Mich. on the 26th of August, 1867, I was
called to the important work of preaching the word of
God.” Signed, Cc, D. Beery.

He remained in this relation to the church until the
924 of December, 1960, under which date we find in the
game book the following record, ““T was ordained to the
bishop's office. May the Lord ald and assist me in this
great and important work.” Signed, C. D. Beery.

In June, 1873, he removed to Jewe)l Co., Kan.; where
he remained not quite a year, and then returned again
to his church in Branch Co., Mich., where he died on
the morning of the 46th of March, 1878, aged 62 years, 8
months and 25 days.

He took sick with lung fever some two weeks previous
and though quite sick, his physicians did not think hw
condition serious. His wife, Nancy, who for some years
had been in rather feeble health, also took sick with the
same disease, and though not considered dangerously ill

at the age of 59 years, 2 months and 13.days, and was to
be buried on Thursday afternoon, Thecoffin had been or-
dered immediately after her death on Wednesday, but
requiring a very large one, it had to be made to order
and the undertaker did not succeed in completing it be-
fore evening. The coffin was then brought, and the
corpse laid into it and conveyed to the grave at the Men-
nonite church, about three miles from the residence,
where it was committed to its last resting place, as the
evening twilight was deepening into the more sombre
“hues of night, and the hymn which her husband had
chosen for the occasion was sung by the light of a
lantern.

On Saturday night previous the passage, 2Tim, 4: 6-8,
came to his mind and he desired that it should be read to
him, so that he might be sure of having it in his mind
correctly, After his wife was dead he seemed fully
reconciled to the will of God and accepted his bereave-
ment with entire resignation, and directed that the
funeral services should be deferred until such a time
that he too could be present; and that ihe words referred
to above should be used as the text for the occasion, nam-
ing also the person whom he desired to perform the
services,

He was most devotedly attached to his wife and spoke
of her frequently, referring to her faithfulness and con.
sistent Christian walk and conversation, and admonish-
ing others to follow her example, At one time he made
the remark, ‘She has fought the good fight; she has
kept the faith; she has washed her robes and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb.” Many times during
the former years of his life he expressed his desire, that
when it should please the Lord to call one of them away
from earth that they might toth be permitted to depart
together, that the separation might be of short duration,
and in this his prayer was fully answered, On Thuraday
after they had taken her to her burial, he remarked to
his nephew, who was with him, that he could not stay
here any longer; he must go to where Nancy was.

During the night he was restless and uneasy and
wished that daylight might come that he m!ght be able
to see out, When the morning came at last, he seemed
cheerful and possessed sufficient strength almost to raise
himself up in his bed. He then conversed freely with his
friends who were with him, and after trying to take a
little rest and sleep he woke up, inquired for his nephew,
Dr. Stemen, who had been with him for several days, and
reaching out his hand to his nephew, George Beery, who
was also with him at the time, he said “Farewell,” and
ina few minutes his spirit winged its way to the spirit
land, and the voice so often raised in earnest entreaty
and admonition to sinners, pointing them to Jesus, the
sinner’s friend, was hushed in death.

He served the church faithfully, and in the discharge
of duties devolving upon him as bishop, he was a man of
great usefulness, and will be greatly missed, not only at
home, in his own church, but also in the surrounding
churches, Even asa neighbor and friend, his loss will bé
deeply felt.

He preached his last sermon in the church where he
lived, on Sunday, three weeks before his burial, from the
text, Luke 7 :45-49, and it was remarked by many of his
hearers, that he spoke with more feeling and earnestness
than usual. He was a man that was firmly grounded in
his faith, and amidst the religious commotions of the
day, he never wavered, but stood faithful at his post, and
until the Lord called him from the watch tower, he
ceased not to sound the trumpet with boldness. He died '
peacefully and both he and his wife died as they had
lived with a firm and abiding faith in Christ, Only about
forty hours intervened between their deaths. They had
been married forty-three years and lived together very
happily. He was buried on Sunday, the 17th, followed to
the grave by a very large concourse of mourners, at
which time the services were held for both by John F.
Funk, aesisted by J. J. Weaver and Peter Long, che dis-
course being preached from 2 Tim. 4:6-8, the words which
the brother had chosen for the services of his wife. May
we.all be enabled to say, “Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my. last end be like this.” No issue.

(1, Joseph Funk, bn. in Berke Co., Pa., Apr. 6, 1778
died Dec, 24, 1862. Mrd, Elizabeth Rhodes, Dec, 25, 1804.
She died Feb, 7, 1814, Children: Jonathan, Henry, Eliza-

Joseph mrd, second wife, Rachel Britton, Sept. 6, 1814,
She died Dec. 9, 1833, Children: Mary, Joseph, David,
Samuel, Hannah, John, Timothy, Solomon, Benjamin.

At a very early age Mr. Funk removed with his
parents to Rockingham Co., Virginia, where he lived
until his death. His life and labors were various and
useful. Sis favorite pursuit was that of sacred music, to
which he gave much attention, both as instructor and as
editor of several popular music books, Hundreds of the
old fathers and mothers in the Valley of Virginia in
which he lived remember him as their instructor, not
only in the sacred art of praise, but as their literary
teacher,

Thousands unknown to him, personally, will cherish
his memory as the instrument through whom their lives
have been cheered, and their devotional hours brightened
by the songs of praise which were brought to them
through his labors,

He was a man of prayer, and had proven its power in
sustaining the soul in a'Nihe varied trials of life. Rigid
in an observance of the decencies of life, and scrupulous
and unswerving in Christian morality, the profane or
disorderly were awed in his presence, or fearlessly
rebuked. :

Firm and confident in the support of his religious
views, he was nevertheless liberal in his Christian inter-
course and fellowship with. those differing from him in
doctrine and external forms,

The Bible was his daily companion, He studied it,
not as a theorist, but to understand its teachings and
practice its precepts. Yet his hope of a blessed immor-
tality was not based upon his own works, but his faith in
the merit of Jesus Christ alone was the surety in which
the hope of his soul was anchored. In the hour of death
he was not forsaken by that faith in which he lived for
nearly seventy years, His last words were, “It ig all well,”
Few men have ever lived in the common walks of fe
who enjoyed a more extensive personal acquaintance,

and more pure and disinterested friendship. He was a
member of the Mennonite church, in which his memory
will long be cherished as a faithful and useful member,
zealous of her welfare and the cause of truth.

Aside from his work as a teacher of vocal music and
a compiler, he also translated from the German language
into English the “Mennonite Confession of Faith,” with
nine reflections written py Peter Burkholder. This work,
al2mo Vol. of 460 pages, he published in 1837, with an
extended introduction, written by himself, giving a brief
sketch of the history of the Mennonite church, and other
interesting matter, from which it is manifest that Joseph
Funk was well read, not only in the Bible, but in religious
literature in general. He established a printing office at
Singers Glen, in 1847, (which was the first Mennonite
printing office in America,) where his popular book of
sacred melodies, ‘The Harmonia Sacra,” known far and
wide, and which passed through many editions, was
printed for many years.

He no doubt also compiled and arranged the first
English Mennonite Hymn Book which he published, and
which also passed through many editions, This book was
arranged to be used in connection with the “Harmonia
Sacra,’ in which appropriate tunes were fourd for all the
hymns. This book, which is still used in some of the Men-
nonite congregations, was also printed on Joseph Funk’s
hand press at Singers Glen, for many years. After tke

‘father’s death the business was continued by Joseph
Funk's Sons, The right to publish the Hymn Book after-

_ wards passed into the hands of John F, Funk & Bro., Elk-
hart, Ind., and is now owned by the Mennonite Publishing
Company. Children:

WV. Mary Funk, bn. July 4, 1815, at Mountain Valley,
(now SingeraGlen) Va died Apr. 19, 1838. Mrd, John Kieffer,
of Rockingham Co., Va., May 30, 1837. After marriage

. they moved to the wilds of Missouri, and settled in Saline
Co., near Miami. Here the struggle of life to make a
home began, in which effort they were happily rewarded.
The years were all happiness, and although two pairs of
hands toiled hard, there were two hearts full of love.
On June 22, 1847, John Kieffer died, and Mary removed to

_ Mountain Vailey, the home of her birth. Here began the
real struggle of her life, to train her children and provide
for them, In this she was successful, despite misfortune
and deprivation.

Mary Kieffer was naturally possessed of more than
ordinary intelligence, a vigorous organism, and large
faith in God's providence; and, like Whittier, she could
exclaim:—

“T know not where His islands lift
Their fronded palms in air;

I only know I cannot drift
Beyond His love and care.”

Her heart was full of sympathy for everyone in
distress, and that sympathy was expressed by deeds of
charity, and not words alone. Duyring the war no soldier
ever called at her gate without being the recipient of
some expression of kindness, and her prayers followed
them to the battle-field. She lived a widow for over forty
years, aud up to the fatal morning of her last illness, she
was engaged in caring for her grandchildren.

In early childhood she connected herself with the
Presbyterian church, Her last hours were full of the
joyful anticipation of rejoining her husband and the two
daughters who had preceded her, and were before the
throne of God and the Lamb, praising Him for the new

DESCENDANTS OF CHRISTIAN FUNK, SON
OF BISHOP HENRY FUNCK.

——

Wt. Rev. Christian Funk, bn. in Franconia Twp., Mont-
gomery Co., Pa. in 1731; died May 31, 1811, aged 80 years.
Mra, Barbara Cassel, daughter of Yelles Cassel.* She
was bn. ——} died Dec. 29, 1792, Lived on the Indian
Creek, where he inherited from his father 187 acres and
146 perches of the old homestead. He afterwards pur-
chased the remaining portion of the old homestead of 63
acres, 19 perches and the mill from his brother, Abraham
Funk, who owned it only about 3 years. Christian Funk
was a large land holder, and in addition to the home-
stead he purchased on Aug. 8, 1790, 40 acres from the
heirs of Dirk Johnson, Samuel Morris and wife Rebecca,
and Catharine Greenleaf, making a total of 241 acres,
and 61 perches, which vast plantation, with the grist
mill, water rights,. buildings and improvements he con-
veyed to his son-in-law, John Detweiler, on July 29, 1794,
for the sum of £3,300 in gold and silver.

Christian Funk was chosen to the ministry at Fran-
conia in 1757 and remained a faithful worker until the
breaking out of the war in 1774, ‘when his troubles com-
menced,’’ an account of which is contained in the His-
tory of Lower Salford Township by James Y. Heckler,
from which we take extracts as follows:

“Tt was during these years which are known as ‘the
time that tried men’s souls,’ that society in this vicinity
was considerably shaken by the surges of the Revolution.

“The Mennonites, though non-resistant, were looked
upon, by the Revolutionary element, as tories, but as

they did not show any signs of hostility to the govern-
ment nor to the army, there was no trouble in that re-
spect; though they suffered the loss of some of their best
horses, some cattle and some grain, which the army was
greatly in need of.

“But the different views entertained by the officials
of the said church in regard to the ‘attest,’ or oath of
allegiance, and the payment of revenues demanded by
the government, brought matters into collision among
themselves. It was principally on this account that
Christian Funk, a Mennonite preacher, with a party of
adherents were expelled from their communion, He
himeelf says, ‘How easily we might have gone through
this war. But no—the Congress and American govern-
ment was rejected as rebellious, and the king acknowl-
edged by my fellow ministers, under the {dea that Con-
gress would soon be overpowered. The war, however,
constantly increased and mutual abuse between those
who were favorable with Congress and those inclined to-
wards the king manifested itself, and discontent was al-
most universal,’

“Christian Funk was not an ignorant man, for he
Was well read and well acquainted with the affairs of the
country, and espoused the cause of the American, Con-
gress as the most reasonable side of the question; for he
knew the causes which brought matters into collision be-
tween the British government and the American colo-
nists, and for taking sides with Congress he was excom-
municated,

“By reading Mr, Funk's own statenient we are led to
the conclusion that he acted too indifferently in those
matters preferred against him, and that if he had beena
little more shrewd and persevering he might have driven
his accusers agaipst the wall,

“But it appears that he still bad hopes of recoacilia-
tion, of being restored to the church of his choice even
in his old age yet; but the ban of excommunication had
been laid upon him and those in office in the Mennonite
church, after many of the former officers were dead, and
when Mr, Funk was an old man, still refused to remove it
and restore him,

“He and his followers organized themselves Into a
church some time after their excommunication, which

was known as the ‘“Funkites.” His influence ex-
tended over a considerable district. They built a meet-
ing house in Evansburg, Lower Providence township; one
on the Skippack, in Towamencin, in 1814, and one about a
mile north of Harleysville in 1814 or 1815. Before build-
ing these houses they held meetings in their homes.

“They had other places of worship, among them
Frick's school house, near Line Lexington, which they
probably built, as well ae the one near Harleysville.

“We will yet add that in 1807 Christian Funk made
his last effort to be restored to his mother church, but on
account of his own church the ban was not removed,
The Mennonites came near yielding so far as to receive
him and bjs members, but they would not receive bis
ministers, He afterwards made a statement of his
troubles, which he left to posterity. This statement is
endorsed by Henry Rosenberger, John Funk, John Reiff,
Henry Gottwals, John Whisler, Christian Gottwals, Jacob
Whisler, John Gottwals, and George Shoemaker.”

After the death of Christian Funk the care of the
church devolved upon his son, John Funk, and about ten
years later began to decline until about the year 1850,
when it became extinct. One of the chief causes of the
decline of the church, was allowing one John Herr, a
heretic from Lancaster county, to preach among them,
and divide them, some taking sides with John Herr; in his
peculiar doctrines, and others opposing, which caused a
division among themselves, a part adhering to the Herr-
ites, and part opposing.

Christian Funk and wife are buried at Delps grave-
yard, Their children are; Anna, Elizabeth, Mary, Cath-
arine, Barbara, Sarah, John, Abraham, Susanna.

Ohio, where they lived several years and then moved to
Mt. Union, Ohio. .

Dr. Munk enlisted as a private soldier in Co. I, 178th
Regt. Ohio Vol. Inf., in August 1864, and remained in
the army until the close of the war. After his return he
attended school at Mt. Union College and later studied
medicine with Dr. D, H. Rosenberg, at Bettsville, Ohio,
and graduated in medicine in 1869 from the Eclectic Med-
ical Institute of Cincinnati, Ohio.

He began the practice of medicine at Lindsey, Ohio,
and has practiced his profession successively at Chilli-
cothe, Mo., Topeka, Kan., and Los Angeles, Cal., at which
latter place he now resides, He isa frequent contributor
to medical journals. His deep interest in the Territory
of Arizona led him to collect an extensive library on that
subject. For several years past he has been collecting
every book, pamphlet, and historical scrap obtainable,
and is to-day possessed of more published and written
information on the Territory than any other living person.
It is expected that some day he will publish a book on
Arizona, which will be the most complete of anything ever
issued from the ‘press. He is also the author of a pam-
phlet on the climate of Southern California.

He was married to Emma Beazell of Webster, Pa., in
1873. Meth. Ep. One child:

graduated, taking his degree of M.D, at the American
Medical College in St. Louis, after which he settled in
Story Co., Iowa, in the practice of medicine. Soon after
he reached the legal age for admission to the rites of
Masonry he entered Columbia Lodge 202. Changing his
residence to the county seat his membership was trans-
ferred to Nevada Lodge No. 99, where he entered into full
fellowship as a Master Mason, June 7, 1873. He hasbeen
an active member of that lodge for more than 20 years,
and has perhaps vouched for as many petitioners as has
any other member. He has filled numerous offices, and
ably performed his full share of work on committees and
on the floor. He holds membership and office in three

He has held the office of Health Officer for the past
ten years. Mrs, Munk isa graduate of Carthage College,

Vi. Judge Edward R. Munk, A. M., who is one of the
prominent lawyers of Arizona, and a pioneer among the
cattlemen in the Territory, has for some years been a
resident of Tucson. Arizona, and is recognized as a.man
of superior ability, force of character, determination and
integrity. He is a native of Stark Co., Ohio. and was bn.
Jan. 31, 1855, and inherits all the thrift, enterprise and
perseverance of his Teutonic ancestors, but contrary to
their custom remains a bachelor. Judge Munk had ex-
cellent educational advantages in his youth, of which he
early availed himself, and graduated when he was 2}
yearsold, After a thorough course in Mt. Union College,
he entered the Michigan University, and was duly gradu-
ated with the post graduate degree of A. M., and shortly
after admitted to the practice of law before the Supreme
Court of the State of Michigan,

For a number of years after this, he practiced his
profession in Des Moines, Iowa, and St, Louis, Mo., but
failing health caused him to give up his practice in the
city, and to seek health and wealth in the far South- wes‘,
Early inthe spring of 1883, he, in connection with his
brother, Dr, J. A. Munk, went into the cattle business
near Wilcox, Arizona, and as hie brother did not reside
there, he has had the entire management of the same,
until the ranch has bécome a very good property, giving
very satisfactory incomes to each of the partners,

Aside from the cattle business the Judge has become
interested in mines and is part owner in a very fair
claim,

In 1886 he was elected County Judge of Cochise Co.,
and re-elected in 1888, serving until the end of his term.
In 1893 he was appointed by President Cleveland as re-
ceiver of the United States Land Office, at Tucson, Ari-
zona, and during his term of office he finished the duties
of his official position in the most satisfactory manner.
Under the administration of Cov. Hughes he was
appointed a member of the 'soard of Regents, and
during his term of office many changes were made in
the policy and management of the University, resulting
in marked success, and never before has the University
enjoyed such prosperity and success as now. The Judge
also became a member of the Civil Service Examining
Board for Arizona, for the Postal and Indian Service,
resulting in credit to the office. In connection with all
these duties he continues to practice his chosen profes-
sion, the law, and with success, thus making his life a
very busy one, He has been connected with the Masonic
order for many years, and is now a Knight Templar in
good standing.

Recently Judge Munk made Los Angeles, Cal., his
permanent home.

Owing to religious scruples he could not continue in the
business with open shop on Sunday, and being fully per-
suaded that it was hie duty to close his shop on Sunday he
resolved todo so, removed to Easton, Pa,, but did not
succeed. He then ona Saturday night took the matter
to the Lord in prayer. He told the Lord that he could
not make a living in Easton with his shop closed on the
Sabbath day, and that he must have a position given him
on the Monday following, and prayed the Lord to direct
his feet for he knew not where to go. The Lord graciously
heard his prayer, and on Monday morning his wife came
to his barber shop witha telegram from his sister, say-
ing, ‘John, come down at once, important business, Rose.”
He took the frst train to Bloomsbury, N.J., and in the
afternoon returned to Easton with tbe key of the Blooms-
bury barber shop in his pocket, to which place he re-
moved, and where he now conducts a successful business.

He and his wife have been faithful members of the River
Brethren church at Lawndale, Pa., for many years. About
80 years ago he was ordained deacon, and in the faithful
discharge of his religious duties it has been his chief joy
to see his beloved Zion prosper in the Lord, while his
patriarchal appearance, and presence in Zion is a source
of inspiration to his fellow laborers in the Master's cause.
In old age he is still abundant in labors for his Redeemer,
and a crown awaits him beyond. “Let me dle the death
of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.” Chil-

town, Pa. After serving his apprenticeship, he was rec-
ommended as being competent of taking charge of an
office, and accordingly was employed as foreman of a
printing office, in Indianapolis, Ind,, Apr. 1, 1884.

In July 1884, at the age of 18 years, he recelved local
preacher's license, and hegan preaching. In the fall of
this year, he resigned his position as foreman of the
printing office, and began to travel as an evangelist or
revivalist on the interdenominational line, laboring in
any church where called. He isa member of the “‘Heav-
enly Recruit Association” church, for which denomina-
tion he has established some churches in Indiana. He
was ordained, and received Elder’s license in July, 1889,

conducted revivals where more than a hundred were
converted in a few weeks. Children:

Dr. Rosenberger assisted his father on the farm,
helping to clear a portion of it, and attended the district
school in the winter. When 18 years of age he entered
Oberlin (Ohio) College. and in 188 commenced the study
of medicine at Findlay, Ohio. He graduated from the
Cleveland (Ohio) Homeopathic Hospital College in 1870,
commenced the practice of medicine inCary. Wyandotte
county, O., in April of the same year, and remained there
until the fall of 1872, when he moved to Leipsic, Putnam
Co.,0. Here he engaged in an extensive practice, hay-
ing to do most of his trateling on horseback, the country
being new, and roads bad. In the fall of 1877 his health
failed, and being unable to endure the hardships of the
practice in that new country, in the spring of 1878 he de-
cided to move to Covington, O., where he has since main-
tained a good practice. In 1865 he connected himself

children to support. At the age of 14 Uriah was com-
pelled to leave school to assist his mother in supporting
the family, and secured a position in a sash and door fac-
tory, where he spent five years of his life. Mr. Stover
had a great desire to secure an education, and in the
meantime applied himself to studying in the evenings
and taking courses in various correspondetice schools.
Having secured a position in Philadelphia, he attended
various night schools. In 1893 he returned to Souderton,
and tn the spring of 1894 began the study of law, which
he is now pursuing with the expectation of being ad-
mitted to the bar in 1899,

In 1895 he was urged to accept the nomination for
Justice of the Peace of the borough of Souderton against
a prominent citizen of that place, and was elected by a
good majority. His oficial conduct and success as Justice
of the Peace insures a prosperous future for the young
man. He isa member of the P. O. S. of A., and wae
elected president of Montgomery District No, 8, which
constitutes a membership of 2,600. Mr. Stover performed
the duties of the office so satisfactorily that he was re-
elected and holds the position at the present time (1898).

N. Fetterolf, one of his aselstants, for five years. Dur-
ing the time of his lease to Prof F., he sold the school

Mr. Hobson is of English ancestry on his paternal
side, the emigrant ancestor being Francis Hobson, who
came from England in 1720, and located in New Garden
township, Chester Co., Pa., with his wife and family.
They were of the Society of Friends, and were amcug the
earliest settlers of that county. Mr. Hobson was a
farmer, His son, Francis Hobson, came to Limerick
township, Montgomery Co., in 1743, and bought a farm of
260 acres near Royers Ford, which is still known as the
Hobson farm, This ancestor had a family, one of whom,
Francis Hobson, in‘:erited the Limerick farm in 1748, and
resided there all his life. He was a country Justice of
the Peace, and a surveyor, and many of the old surveys
of the county were made by him. One of his sons, John
Hobson, was the grandfather of our subject. He in his
turn inherited and worked the Limerick farm, making
three generations on this property. John Hobson was the
father of four children: Moses, Mary, Charlotte and
Francis, father of our subject, who was born Oct. 10, 1803;
died Aug. 4, 1874. He inherited the farm in Limerick
township, and lived there many years, subsequently re-
moving to Reading. He was a soldier in the war of the
Rebellion. He married Matilda Bringlurst, and had two
children, Frank M., our subject, and Sarah, wife of Rev.
Henry W. Super, D. D,, ex-president of Ursinus College.
William Bringhurst, father of our subject’s mother, mar-
ried Mary Morris, on June 4, 1769, and had two children,
Elizabeth, wife of Adam Harkness; and Israel, who was
born Feb, 28, 1770, and died Feb. 1807. Israel Bringhurst
had a family of eight children, among whom was Wright
A. Bringhurst, who was a member of the State Legisla-
ture, and became a man of considerable note, At his
death he bequeathed $200,000 for the support of the desti-
tute poor of Norristown, Pottstown and Upper Providence
township, Through the wife of William Bringhurst, our
subject isa descendant of Jenkin Jenkins, who was born
in Wales, in 1659, and came to this country in 1720, and
located in Gwynedd. Ref. ch. Children: Freeland, Mary.

subject of this sketch, was educated in the public schools
of Upper Providence Twp., subsequently took a full course
in and graduated from Urainus College in 1876, He then
entered the law office of Jacob V. Gotwals, at that time
district attorney of Montgomery county, and was ad-
mitted to the bar on Oct. 1, 1880. He immediately opened
an office in Norristown, where he soon began to build up
a lucrative practice, and where he has remained ever
since. He is an eloquent pleader, and has been uniformly
successful in the trial of cases. He defended Antonio
Fredricko, an Italian, who was tried in 1890 for the
murder of a fellow countryman, ‘The murder occurred at
Conshohocken, and Fredricko was captured at San Fran-
cisco, The trial was a most thrilling one, and resulted in
the absolute acquittal of the accused. Mr. Hobson re-
ceived the congratulations of his colleagues for the man-
ner in which he had conducted the defense.

In September, 1888, Mr. Hobson put on foot the move-
ment to organize The Norristown Title, Trust and Safe
Deposit Company, and solicited most of the stock, He
was made its secretary, treasurer, and frust officer.
These positions he has held since that time, This insti-
tution has rapidly grown in popular favor, and now ranks
as one of the most flourishing financial institutions of the
county. He is aleo founder and publisher of the Mont-
gomery County Law Reporter, which is now in its four-
teenth volume, He is a member of the Montgomery
County Historical Society, and is the author of the
History of Providence Township, and one of the contribu
tors to Col. Bean’s History of Montgomery County, writ-
ing much of the township work. He has always taken
great interest in public movements, and in 1884, when the
Centennial celebration of Montgomery county was cele-
brated, he was chairman of the executive committee, It
was in no amall degree owing to his energy that this
celebration was such a success, He was editor-in-chief
of a beautiful memorial volume commemorating this
event.

Mr. Hobson {e a leader in the Patriotic Order Sons of
America and is a member of Camp 267, at Ironbridge. In
August, 1893, he was elected State President at the State
convention held at Chester, Pa. At the conclusion of his
term, at Erie, Pa., he was made the happy recipient of a

Vv. Elizabeth Detweiler, died about 1842, Mrd. Rev.
John Hunsicker,* May 9, 1797. He was born in Skippack
Twp., Montgomery Co., Pa., in 1772; died 1847. Farmer,
lived on the farm now owned by his grandson, John S.
Hunsicker, in Perkiomen Twp. He was an ordained
Mennonite minister for nearly forty years, and succeeded
his father as Bishop, who had been in the ministry Sity-
four years.

The means of obtaining an education were poor when
he was young, but natural talent and a strong ‘mind
enabled him to acquire knowledge far teyond many of
his time, :

He was not of an aggressive spirit, but rather ofa
mild nature and kindly disposition, yet he broke away
from some of the rigid and exacting customs peculiar to
the sect to which he belonged. He was progressive, and
availed himself of means for information. He was a
contributing member of the Trappe Literary Society
which flourished about 1840, and read many of the books
of its library.

Hie mental characteristics are plainly traceable
through his children, giving evidence in the production
of professional talent, as well as character, in his grand-
children, three of whom are distinguished lawyers, three
are ministers of the gospel, though of different denomi-
nations, and one occupies the distinguished position of
President of Girard College in Philadelphia. Children:
Joseph, Henry, Mary, Sarah, Elizabeth, Garret.

and son of Bishop Henry Hunsicker, and Esther Detweiler, his wife.

Mr. Hendricks was reared on his father’s farm, and
in the spring of 1851, entered Freeland Seminary (now
Ureinus College), and in the fall of 1852, took charge of a
public school in Milford Square, Bucks county. During
the four consecutive winters that he was a teacher in the
public schools, he attended Freeland Seminary during
the summer months, In Feb., 1856, he was appointed to
the position of assistant teacher in Freeland Seminary,
and in two years he was promoted to teach the higher

mathematics and was made vice-principal of the in-
stitution.

It was while engaged in these duties that at a meet-
ing of the Christian society at Freeland (now College-
ville), held in A. D, 1860, he was, according to the usages
of the church, of which he was a member, elected on trial
to the office of the ministry. He at once began to attend
to the duties of his new position in connection with his
school work, On June 25, 1861, he was ordained to the
office of minister of the goepel.

The Christian society materialized and was incorpo-
rated in the spring of 1855. The society built for itself
in 1854, what was styled the “Christian Meeting House,”
and the same was opened in the spring of 1855 for public
worship. In February, 1862, Mr. Hendricks was elected
pastor of the Christian society, and was installed in
April, 1862, At this time the duties of his new office
occupied so much of his time that he was compelled to
resign his position as teacher and vice-principal of Free-
land Seminary. To give a sketch of Mr, Hendricks’ life-
work, isto give a history of what is now Trinity Reformed
church, Collegeville, Pa., the two being closely and indis-
soluably inter-related. He’ is now in the thirty-seventh
year of his pastorate. He has been actively connected
with and engaged in the Sunday school during all its past
history, commencing in the spring of 1856, For twenty-
eight consecutive years he was superintendent. During
the forty-two years of its existence he has been teaching
and leading the singing. During the pastorate the
church has been continually enlarged. The church build-
ing has been very materially enlarged, improved and
beautified, and at present a new cut stone front is being
erected. The church yard and cemetery grounds also
extend to twice their original size. A very creditable
church has also, during the pastorate, been founded, well
organized and built up at Skippackville. Collegeville
church owns and controls a fine chapel at Ironbridge,
used for Sunday school and church purposes.

The original Christian society, subsequently Trinity
church, was organized and continued as an independert
church, until 1888, when it was received into formal fel-
lowship with the Reformed church in the United States:
Tn 1892, the Skippackville church was also formally made

part of the same denomination, Collegeville church, as
it is, is made up of Trinity church, Collegeville; Trinity
church, Skippackville; and Ironbridge chapel, Rahn Sta-
tion, With its three Christian Endeavor societies, its
three Sunday schools, and its other auxiliary church
services, it is a very influential church, and has grown to
its present proportions and prominence from averysmall
beginning, under the pastorate of Dr. Hendricks,

Mr. Hendricks enjoys the distinction of having served
the same charge longer than any other living pastor in
Montgomery county, and out of nine hundred funerals at
which he has been asked to officiate, he bas never missed
any on account of sickness, and has only missed, in a third
ofacentury, three church services on account of any
bodily sickness; and in all these years he has had but one
trief pastor’s vacation, The late Moses Auge wrote for
the general public, of Mr. Hendricks, eight years ago,
that he is “greatly beloved by his own congregation, and
is in much demand outside of his own churches, especially
to officiate at funerals. He is a fluent and forcible
preacher, speaking entirely extempore, in a rapid, earnest
and convincing manner, impressing every one with the
absolute conviction of the truth of what he is saying.”
Mr. Hendricks has delivered numerous addresses at Sun-
day school picnics, public school commencements, national
Thankegivings, and Decoration day exercises, and to the
G. A. R. Posta, for which he has received words and testi-
monials of high appreciation. In June, 1881, the Board
of Directors of Ursinus College, upon the recommenda-
tion of its faculty, conferred on Mr. Hendricks the honor-
ary degree of Master of Arts; and in June, 1897, the same
college conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Di-
vinity. Children: Lizzie, Ella, Bertha, Abraham, Sallie.

Vi. Adam H. Fetterolf, Ph. D., LL. D., President of
Girard College, was born in Montgomery Co:, Pa., in 1842,
He is in the prime of a life, the adult years of which have
been given to educational pursuits. His career. has been
mainly that of a student and teacher.

His academic training wae acquired at the Freeland
Seminary, then under the management of Rev. Henry A,
Hunsicker, After completing his course, and teaching
for a time in the public schools, Dr. Fetterolf connected
himself with the institution as professor of mathematics,
and subsequently purchased Mr. Hunsicker's interest and
became proprietor and p:‘ucipal.

He conducted the institution very successfully for
five years, when the buildings and grounds were pur-
chased for Ursinus College.

Professor Fetterolf then associated himself with Rev.
Dr. Wells in the ownership and Management of Anda-
lusia Academy, in Bucks county,

After the death of Dr. Wells, in 1871, he assumed the
entire charge, and continued at the head of the Academy
for the next five years. In 1880 he was elected by the
Board of City Trusts to fill the chair of Vice-President of
Girard College At the death of President Allen, two
yeavs later, Professor Wetterolf was chosen to succeed
hirs. He has held the position ana discharged the mani-
fold duties ever since, wit the confidence of the Board,
and the approbation of the public,

The college of which Dr. Petterolf is now President
was founded by Stephen Girard, a native of France, who
had amassed an immense fortune asa shipping merchant
and banker in Philadelphia, where he had arrived a poor
boy, and begun business in a very humble way, and who
bequeathed $2,000,000 and the residue of bis estate, after
paying certain legacies, for the erection and support of a
college for orphans. As many poor, white, male orphans
who are residents of Pennsylvania, are admitted between
the ages of six and ten years, as the endowment can sup-

‘port, They are fed, clothed, and educated, and between
the ages of fourteen and eighteen may leave the college
to puraue mechanical, commercial, and agricultural oc-
cupations, They are given manual as well as mental
training, and are in great demand in the shops, and in
the manufactories of Philadelphia, as skilled workmen,
after they have graduated.

The government of Girard College demands high and
rather peculiar qualifications. The position of the Presi-
dent is one of great reaponalbility, standing as he does in

loco parentis to over fifteen hundred orphan boys—the rep-
resentative head of the greatest individual charity on
the continent,

President Fetterolf has the charm of a genial, quiet,
well-balanced character, a pleasing address, an impres-
sive presence, and that subtle faculty which wins the
confidence of boys. He is the fourth president of the
college. The first presided over but two hundred boys;
the second saw five hundred assembled at chapel; the
third witnessed the roll lengthen to eleven hundred;
while Dr, Fetterolf has over fifteen hundred under his
charge. It requires executive ability of the highest
order to successfully direct the destinies and control the
actions of 60 many undeveloped mental and physical
organisms, and that President Fetterolf is able to accom-
plish this without harsh discipline, demonstrates in the
strongest possible way his eminent fitness for the re-
sponsible position he occupies. His abilities have had
numerous recognitions from the faculties of other col-
leges, the most recent of which was the conferring upon
him of the degrees of A.M. and Ph. D., by Lafayette
College, and by Delaware College of the title of LL. D.

In May, 1887, the Legislature of Pennsylvania passed
an act authorizing and requesting the Governor to ap-
point a commission of five citizens of the commonwealth
to ‘make inquiry and report, by bill or otherwise, respect-
ing the subject of Industrial Education.” Gov. Beaver
placed President Fetterolf on this commission, his already
extensive knowledge of the subject making the selection
especially valuable and appropriate,

Dr. Fetterolf has been twice married, and has two
sons. His first wife was Miss Annie Hergesheimer,
daughter of George Hergesheimer, Esq., of Germantown.
Children: George, Edwin,

In 1888 he married Miss Laura M. Mangam, daughter
of William D, Mangam, Esq., of Brooklyn, N. Y.

Vil. George Fetterolf, M. D., bn. at Collegeville,
Montgomery Co., Pa., Mar. 31, 1869; was educated at his
father’s school at Andalusia, Bucks Co., Pa., until he was
twelve years of age. In 1881 he entered the fourth form
of the Protestant Episcopal Academy, Philadelphia,
graduating there in 1883,

He then entered the Freshman class of the University
of Pennsylvania, taking his Bachelor of Arts degree in
1887. From 1887-88 he was Demonstrator of Embryology
and Botany in the University of Pennsylvania Biological
School. In 1888 he entered the University Medical School
and graduated there May 1, 1891. On May 2, 1891, he

Luke's Hospital, So, Bethlehem, Pa., which he completed
on May 1, 1893, He then returned to Philadelphia, and in
August, 1893, he began the practice of medicine at his

maternal grandparents until 16 years of age. He at-
tended the common schools of the vicinity, and at an
early age was sent to Freeland Seminary, at Collegeville,
Pa., now known as Ursinus College, which he attended
three years,

’. The two years following he taught public schools,
giving general satisfaction. When 19 years of age he
commenced the study of medicine with his uncle, Dr. Jo-
seph Moyer, a successful practitioner residing at Kulps-
ville, Pa.

He afterwards entered Pennsylvania Medical Uni-
versity, from which he graduated March 6, 1859, and on
the 26th day of thesame month located at Plumsteadville,
Bucks Co., Pa., where he engaged in a lucrative practice
for nine years, In the spring of 1868, he sold his practice
and traveled considerably during that year. On Apr. 5,
1869, he resumed practicing medicine, and located at
Quakertown, Pa., having purchased the practice of Drs.
Joseph Thomas and Richard J. Linderman. Here he re-
sided for some time and enjoyed a larger practice than at
his former place. When quite young he manifested a
love for botany, the study of which heever after followed
with pleasure and profit. He thoroughly investigated the
flora of Bucks county, and in 1876 published a catalogue
of plants of said county, which was added to Gen. W. W.
H. Davis’ Histery of Bucks County. This was the first
published flora of the coun ty.

The Doctor studied natural history generally, and was
well versed in entomology and ornithology. He was a
member of the Lehigh Valley Medical Association, of the
board of censors of the Medico-Chirurgical College of
Philadelphia, of Quakertown Lodge No. 512, F. & A. M.,

menced teaching, and until 1868 taught successively in
the Deep Run, Rocky Ridge, Algards, Sellersville, and
Plumstead schools. In 1868 he took charge of the West

troduced a number of improvements in the public schools
of that municipality. Having been offered still better
inducements by the Board of Education of the Lehighton
Borough schools, he became principal and supervisor of
” the schools of that growing town on the Lehigh, and later
principal of the public school of Wyoming, Luzerne Co.,
Pa. He is at present engaged in teaching in the city of
Philadelphia, Pa, ©

Through all these years of teaching there is one idea
that has never been lost sight of, namely, that of self-
improvement, The schooling at the academy was only
tne beginning of a life of study. In 1876 he appeared
before the State Board of Examiners, passed the exami-
nations, and was granted a Normal Certificate as teacher
of Didactics. He found much pleasure in pursuing a
course of general studies in-science and language, and in
1877 Franklin and Marshall College recognized his indus.
try asa student, and conferred upon him the honorary
degree of A. M. :

He has been a member of the Pennsylvania State
Teachers’ Association since 1877, and an active member
of the Touvey Botanical Club of Columbia College, New
York City, since Oct., 1881, Having the confidence of the
people at his permanent home in Coplay, he was fre-
quently called upon to fill positions of honor and responsi-
bility.. He was the frat commissioned Justice of the
Peace of the borough, and continuously held the office
from 1869 to 1890. He was secretary of the town council
for thirteen years, and a school director whileserving the
Coplay Iron Co, The Judges of the Courts frequently
appointed him to serve on road juries and commissions,
and there are few townships ‘in Lehigh Co. in which he
has not been called to execute these appointments,

Being a member of the Ref. ch., he took active inter-
est in the founding of Trinity congregation at Coplay, in
1872, He served as deacon'and was for many years secre-
tary of the coneistory. He was the superintendent of the
Sunday school of this congregation for eighteen years,

In the spring of 1879, he entered the Normal school
at Huntingdon, Pa., where he graduated in 1880. The
next two years were spent in teaching school at Stewarts-
ville, and at Alexandria, Pa., and in taking advanced
studies in Huntingdon Normal College. In the fall of
1882 he entered the Senior Preparatory class at Oberlin
College, Oberlin, Ohio, finishing this course in 1883. In
the latter part of this year he was called to fill a position
in the preparatory department of Mt. Morris College,
Mt. Morris, I, teaching Latin, Greek and English
literature. This position he held for three years, finish-
ing in the meantime the regular studies of the Freshman
year in college. During this perlod, June 19, 1884, he
married Elizabeth Leslie, of Nappanee, Ind., who had
been a former student of Huntingdon Normal School, of
Huntingdon, Pa. In the fall of 1886 he moved with his
family to Oberlin, Ohio, to enter the Sophomore class of
that college. .

By means of teaching, leading choir, and the most
rigid economy he managed to support his family, con-
tinue his studies, and complete his college course free of
debt, graduating with honors in the classical course of
1889, It had been his intention to continue his studies in
the Theological Seminary, but, unable to do this satis-
factorily to himself, owing to lack of funds, it was
thought best at this time to seek some employment to
replenish the depleted treasury. Just then an opening
was found in the West, and in November, 1880, he joined
his former class-mate, H. Il. Hall, at Des Moines, Iowa,
and engaged in selling school supplies. Success during
the firat year at this enterprise resulted ia being ad-
mitted ae an equal partner into the firm known as the
Western School Supply House, Des Moines, Iowa, with
which he is still connected. This company now incorpor-
ated with H. L. Hall, president, and H. P. Moyer, vice-
president and treasurer, controls some valuable patents,
and has been doing a flourishing business.

Mr. Moyer’s college work was characterized by con-
siderable special work involving original investigations.
Several of his writings on religious subjects have received
favorable comment from able critics. He has since kept
up his Hterary interests, and is devoting considerable
attention to reform movements, especially along the line

of the growing movement of Christian Socialism. In the
midst of a busy business life he finds time to be the
active leader of his church choir, teacher of a large and
enthusiastic Bible class, and secretary of the Federation
of Evangelical churches in his city. His activity in
literary, musical, religious, and reform work promises
substantial results in the future, Cong. ch. Children:

i, Rev. Joho Funk, dec’d. Mrd. Ann —. She died
May 5, 1797, aged 34 yrs.,3 mos. Farmer. After the death
of his father, the care of the church known as the “Funk-
ites” was ina great measure committed to his manage-
ment, but it is said that he did not excel in his calling,
(though he was a good man), and in consequence the
church declined. His tine large farm, located east of the
lower end of Evansburg, on the Skippack Creek, he in-
herited from his father. During the war of 1812 he took
to speculating, and when the crisis came after the war,
his property was swept away, and he became dependent.
Tradition hands down a saying of his, to his boys, (one a
merchant, and the other running the farm,) “Buy land,
boys, buy land, plenty of money, they make money at
Norristown.” He finally moved to Berks Co., and died
there. Children: Abraham, Magdalena, John, Catharine,
and by a second wife, four daughters.

During the early part of his life he was engaged in
the tobacco and cigar business, in which business he con-
tinued until the Lord enlightened his mind, when he gave
it up, together with the habit of smoking and chewing,
the Lord taking away the appetite in answer to prayer.

He was Post master at Collegeville for about nine
years, after which he moved to Philadelphia. He was
converted in Feb., 1850. In 1858 his health failed, and
in the winter of 1860 he expected to die of an incurable
disease; but while on his knees he opened the Bible on
the following passage, ‘The Lord has atAlicted thee sore,
but hast not given thee over unto death. Thou shalt not
die, but live and declare the works of the Word.” The next
day, without any effort, he again opened the Bible and his
eyes lighted on the same passage. That was his call to
preach, when he thought he was todie. His physician
told him he’ might live two or three years if he would
move to the country, which he did in May, 1861, and he is
yet living, but the doctor has been dead some years.

In 1864 he received license to preach at Evansburg
Quarterly Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church,
by Rev. Wm. Grey, P. E., and was ordained deacon in
1875, at the Philadelphia conference, held at Norristown:
Pa., by Bish. Matthew Simpson. He has served as a sup-
ply at St. Luke’s Reformed church, Trappe, and had a
call toa church of that denomiovation, but owing to the
fact that he had been broken down in health for more
than fifteen years, Le thought it unwise to take pastor-
ate of any church.

The greatest work of his life occurred since 1861.
The Lord who called him through the most physical
weakness, has done wonders in three separate revivals in
the county.

In 1879, just before the greatest work, all things con-
sidered, of his life of which the Lord made him instru-
mental, the Lord opened his eyes on the doctrine of
entire sanctification, and a desire for it. He sought it
without delay, and obtained the blessing which he enjoys
to this day, only more matured. He is now leader of a
Holiness meeting of the Meth. Ep. church, at 20th and
Jefferson Sts., Philadelphia, Pa.

DESCENDANTS OF ABRAHAM FUNK,
SON OF BISHOP HENRY FUNCK.

'. Abraham Funk, bn. in Montgomery Co., Pa., Nov.
21, 1784; died in Springfield Twp., Bucks Co,, Pa., Apr. 16,
1788, from the effects of a stroke of palsy, received on his
way home from church, Mrd. Mary Landis, Jan. 19, 1758,
She died Feb., 1826. After the death of hia father, he be-
came owner of the old homestead of 53 acres, and the mill
at Indian Creek, Montgomery Co., which he sold in 1763
to his brother, Christian Funk, having owned it only
three years, :

We insert here the following interesting sketch of
the life of (I.) Henry Funck, father of (I.) Abraham Funk,
and founder of this mill, with a history of the same,
which was written by W. H. Richardson, of Philadelphia,
Pa., and published in the Miller’s Review. W. H. Rich-
ardeon is also a descendant of the founder of the mill.

Among the multitudes of Europeans attracted to-
America some two centuries ago were thousands of
Palatines who swelled the population of the new
world then, and enriched the stock which peopled
it in all generations since. A great many of these
early German settlers were Mennonites, or followers
of the teachings of Menno Simons, a native of Fries-
land. Early in life he was a priest in the Roman church,
but in 1536 he severed his connection with it, and became
recognized as one of the leaders of the sect which was so
bitterly and so relentlessly persecuted—indeed one writer
has said that even the sufferings of the primitive Chris-
tians did not compare with the nameless horrors to which
these Mennonite martyrs submitted. Among the methods
by which so many of them met death calmly and unflinch-

ingly it is recorded that some were buried alive, others
were burned, some were torn on the rack, others were
hung, while the most fearful tortures were applied to
those from whom confession of error might be wrung, or
recantation, or information about their fellows might be
extorted, So many of these atrocities were perpetrated
while the Netherlands were under Spanish domination,
that one of the results of the intolerance was to widely
disperse the Dutch Mennonites into countries in which
there was a greater liberality of thought in religious
matters.

For a century and a half, however, those of the refu-
gees and their descendants who had expected to find an
asylum in the Rhenish provinces, had been persecuted
with varying degrees of bitterness—burning and pillag-
ing their property being the mildest expressions of their
enemtes’ feeling for them—and so when Penn, who needed
settlers for his “elysium,” presented them with an invi-
tation to go to the new land, holding out to them the
glittering prospect of religious freedom, they went, and
the tide of emigration from the Fatherland swept on for
many years, To-day if you should hear of millers with
names sounding anything like Kuster, Hendricks, Nor-
dyke, Yokum, Bean, Rhoads, Gotwals, Jacobs, Royer,
Zimmerman, Shoemaker, Rittenhouse, Landis, Brubaker,
Kulp, Weaver, Snyder, Bowman, Acker, Zug, Miller,
Cassel, Wagner, Wentz—a . .nere are many more—it is
likely that those millers can trace their origin back to-
martyr ancestors, who chose to be of that great throng
which entered the Kingdom through much tribulation.

Among the Mennonite immigrants to Pennsylvania
was Henry Funck. He settled along the Indian Creek, in
what is now the upper part of Montgomery county, a
couple of miles from the preseut village of Harleysville.
He came to that wilderness ‘ne cells us that his nearest
neighbor was five miles av ay) in the year 1719 and he
gave up the wonderfully basy life he led in it in 1760,
when hie neighbors carried his body out of his old home,
and buried it in a quiet spot beneath the trees, some-
where on the broad acres he hac owned and tended and
loved. A reference to what was accomplished by this
great man (for so he will be considered when people
commence to read and weigh history aright) will be of

interest to all our miller readers for the reason that
Henry Funck was a miller. He was a deep scholar; he was
a preacher in the Mennonite church and for some years a
bishop; he looked after a large farm; he was the author
of two books, one of which was published in 1774 and rah
through at least five additions, while the other one, pub-
lished three years after his death, was meritorious enough
to run through three editions, being reprinted in Switz
erland in 1844, and again in Lancaster in 1862. He was
prominent in another literary enterprise, which will be
referred to later; and he was the father of a large family
of children—there were ten in the flock he reared. Any
one of his occupations would probably be considered a
fairly good sized job for a man of this generation. Tosay
that the world was better for Henry Funck’s having lived
in it is a plain way of stating a plain truth for all people,
and it will not be without profit for millers to know that
it was one of their craft whom history will some day
delight to honor.

Time will pay the greatest tribute to Henry Funck for
the work he did in connection with a publication, which
has keen appropriately termed the noblest specimen of
American colonial bibliography, the so-called “Martyr
Book,” printed at the Ephrata cloister in 1748, It was a
translation of Tieleman Jans van Braght’s great histori-
cal book of Mennonites, published in Dordrecht, Holland,
in 1660. It was compiled from many smaller publications
that appeared during the previous century, the owners
and authors of which were, in many instances, burned
with their books by the executioner. In the van Braght
book the story of the Mennonites is told, and it tells
especially of their sufferings for the sake of their rellg-
ion, and describes, in all the horrible details, the death of
many of their martyrs. Next to their Bible the book was
most widely read, as the knowledge of it gave them
courage and calmness under the terrible conditions in
which they lived for so many generation:.

Prior to 1748 the difficulty here was that there was no
complete German translation, for German was the tongue
almost universally used among these American Menno-
nites; the original Martyr Book was in Dutch. England,
which through Penn’s pledge had granted them religious
freedom, had gotten into trouble with France, and in 1744

war was declared. And then fearful of the result whicb
might again confront them with the alternative of an-
other creed or persecution, these peace-loving and non-
resisting people declared, “it becomes us to strengthen
ourselves for such circumstances with patience and en-
durance, and to make every preparation for steadfast
constancy in our faith.” So, in 1745, six of them—of whom
Henry Funck was one—wrote to their brethren in Holland
for information and assistance that would give them a
German translation in which their own people and their
posterity could ‘see the traces of those faithful witnesses
who have walked in the way of truth and given up their
lives for it.” .

It took the proverbially slow Dutchmen three years
to make up their minds in the matter, and then they
wrote back to America that it would be impracticable to
undertake the work on account of the great expense in-
volved, and also because a translator who could do justice
to the subject could not be found. They sent along the
rather quaint suggestion that it would be very wholesome
for the rising generation to be required to copy in pen
and ink the principal parts of the pook which could be
translated by the older people who were skilled in the
two languages, but Henry Funck and his associates had
not waited for this advice. In 1745 they concluded a very
advantageous arrangement with the mystical Dunkers at
Ephrata, to have the pook translated and printed, and 80
the work which, according to the judgment of that dis-
tinguished scholar, Hon. 8. W. Pennypacker, marked an
epoch in the literary history of America, was undertaken.

Two men—Henry Funck was one, Dielman Kolb the
other—were appointed to supervise the translation, and
so devoted were they that they gave three years of their
time and labor to it, inspecting each leaf as it came from
the press, going over each in order to compare it with
the original and see that nothing was lost. They gave
their certificate that they had read every one of the 1512
folio pages carefully, that the translation (which was
nearly all done by the learned Prior of the Ephrata com-
munity) was in all respects, #0 far as they could judge, a
faithful rendering of the original. Twelve hundred copies
were printed and most of them aold. Some of the sheets
were stili at Ephrata at the opening of. the Revolution.

The Government having need of “all war material and
also paper,” and the members of the community having
refused to give up what they had, two wagons and six
soldiers were sent and they carried off the rest of the
martyr books, and so in spite of the peaceful intentions
of the Mennonites their books were put to a most san-
guinary use, for it is not unlikely that many a British
trooper stopped the bullets which were sped on their
blood-thiraty mission by wads of paper containing latter-
day versions of the gospel of “Peace on earth.”

Henry Funck’s mill still stands; it is owned and oper-
ated to-day by H.M, Musselman. It is, of courss, some-
what changed in external appearance since the dayr of
its distinguished founder; some years ago fire destroyed
much of its old woodwork and a later owner built an
additional story of frame above the substantial walls. A
steam 2ngine is a modern installation, too, to help along
in times when Indian Creek is low and the forebay is
simply a puddle for the frogs to bathe in. There is a pair
of ancient bubr stones in the mill, and as one listens to
their droning song, with its click-a-clack, click-a-clack
accompaniment, hi3 fancy easily wanders back to the
days of the miller who made so good a name for himself,
and who left us of this generation 80 goodly a heritage.
One of the curiosities Mr. Musselman will show you, if
, you ask him, is a bundle of old deeds running back to the

earliest ownership in the place, and on one of them,
dated 1773, is fastened the great seal of the province. It
ia an unusually good impression, and the signature of
Thomas Penn, one of the proprietors and the second son
of the Quaker founder, is apparently as fresh as the day
it was written, one hundred and sixty-five years ago.—
Written by W. H.R.

After the sale of the mill (i) Abraham Funk moved
to Springfield Twp., Bucks Co., Pa., at what is now
Springtown, where he purchased on the 27th day of May,
1768, a “plantation of land with a water grist mill, houses
and out-houses, mill and mill-houses, and other buildings,
races, dams and water rights,”’ ‘containing by estimation
300 acres with an allowance of six per cent for roads,
from Stephen Twining, of ‘Wrightstown, Bucks Co., Prov-
ince of Pennsylvania, for the sum of £1570 lawful money

of Pennsylvania. This tract being a part of 661 acres
which by a propretary patent of the 10th day of May,
1788, was granted unto Caspar Wistar, of the city of
Philadelpbia, who, the 26th day of May of the same year
(1738), sold 500 acres of this tract to Stephen Twining, who
built for himself a dwelling and other puildings. The old
homestead in which Abraham Funk lived and died was a
large log mansion, built either by Twining or Funk,
probably the latter, one story and a halt high, with three
rooms on the first floor, and several on the second floor:
and stood across the road, directly opposite the present
dwelling, the site of which is now covered by the mill
pond.

The mill was the firet in Springfeld Twp., and was
built by Stephen Twining in 1738, This mill was torn
down and rebuilt on the same site by Abraham Funk, in
1782, being a substantial stone structure, three stories
high, with three run of stone, and which stood and did
service for 81 yeara, when it wae toro down and rebuilt in
1863, by Henry S. Funk, the present owner. In addition
to the grist mill, Abraham Funk aleo bullt a saw mill. He
also purchased another tract of land from Catharine
Greenleaf (widow), containing 96 acres, on which Spring-
town now stands, which, after reserving all rights, springs
and tributaries, he sold (the 96 acres) to his brother, Heary
Funk, Sr., late of Upper Milford Twp., Northampton (now
Lehigh) Co., on the 29th day of May, 1784, for £650, and
who in turn sold it to his nephew, Henry Funk, son of
Abraham Funk, on the Ith day of November, 1795, for
the sum of £1002 of gold and silver money. Abraham
Funk aleo owned a property in Upper Milford Twp.,

Northampton Co., of 56 acres, on which were a saw mill
and hemp mill erected. He also owned several other
properties of emailer dimensions in Springfield Twp.

Abraham Funk, in locating his home, made a wise
selection and settled in a beautiful and fertile valley,
with a good and never failing supply of water from nu-
merous springs scattered through the valley, and which
latter feature was the prime motive in his locating here,
there being a scarcity of water at the old mill he inherited
from his father in Francoula. 7

From the Penn manuscripts purchased by the Histor-
ical Society of Pennsylvania, we are enabled to state that

the event known in history as the famous Indian walk,
which took place the 19th and 20th of September, 1737,
crossed this place, and the participants in that walk took
their dinner on the first day’s walk by a spring probably
where the mill now stands, and near the abode of one
Geo. Wilson, an Indian trader and squatter. Owing to
the fact that Wilson the Indian trader had hie abode
here, and numerous arrow heads and Indian implements,
Pipes, battle axes, etc., having been found, attest the
fact that this valley was at one time the abode also of
the red man, and an Indian burying ground is known to
exist on the Funk tract.

A mineral spring exists on this place which was die-
covered about 1844, which has been analyzed several times
and found to contain great beneficial qualities.

About 200 feet back ofthe present dwelling a cave
was discovered in the summer of 1893 by one of the work-
men while plowing, one of the horses breaking through
the thin crust of earth, revealing a cave of immense
Proportions.

Henry H. Funk, son of Hon. Heury S. Funk, and
great-great-great-grandson of Bishop Henry funck, was
let into the cave by means of a rope around his body, and
was the first one to enter and explore the cave. He was
let down about 40 feet to the bottom of the first opening
where he found a small aperture through which he crept
a distance of about 5 feet intoa large cavern into which
no light of day penetrates. He sent for lights which
were let down to him, and after wandering about for
several hours, he was joined by his father; they set out to
examine the cavern more thoroughly, and discovered a
lake of pure crystal water, the size and depth of which
has not yet been ascertained. It is supposed that the
spring underneath the water-wheel of the mill, which
throws up a stream of water about six inches in diameter
has its source from this lake.

As to any official position occupied by Abraham Funk
nothing is known, It is said, however, that during the
Revolution he was impressed as teamster in which capac:
ity he served three months during which time he was an
eye witness of the battle of Brandywine, but we would
rather believe that he sent his eldest son Henry, then a
lad of 17, with the team.

Of the personal characteristics of Abraham Funk,
put little is known. However, judging from his numerous
real estate transactions from records and documents in
the possession of Henry 5. Funk, it is evident that he was
a very shrewd business man. He was successful in accu-
mulating a large amount of wealth. The inventory of his
personal property at his death amounted to $10,320 be-
sides owning over 500 acres of improved real estate unin-
cumbered.

He was a man of upright character and strict integ-
rity, and was a prominent member of the Mennonite
church of Springfield, where he and wife are buried.
Children: Henry, Anna, Jacob, John, Catharine, Eliza-
beth, Susanna, Abraham, ——.

On the death of his father, Henry Funk came into
possession of the old homestead tract with grist and saw
mill, also the tract on which Springtown now stands, and
a tract of land with saw mill and hemp mill in Upper
Milford Twp., and several other tracts, aggregating over
600 acres. Of the old homestead tract he sold to his
brothers, Jacob and John, over 200 acres in 1792, and three
years later re-purchased a greater portion of it. He first
lived in the old log mansion, but in 1796 erected a large,
substantial stone dwelling on the opposite side of the
road, directly in front of the old log house, which was
completed about Christmas, and moved into it between
Christmas and New Year of the same year. . :

The new dwelling was the largest, most commodious,
and finest in the entire region of the country round about.
It is built of limestoue upon solid rock, with foundation

walls 3 feet thick, with open fireplaces in every room of
the house, 20 panes of glass in every window. -

The exterior and interior of the house remains un-
changed to this day, and is in an excellent state of pres-
ervation, and is the present home of: the Hon. Henry S.
Funk.

The old log mansion in which Abraham Funk lived
and died, and from which his son Henry moved into the
new dwelling, was afterwards used for a blacksmith shop
and wash house, until it was torn down and removed
about 1830.

Henry Funk remained on the old homestead until hia
death, managing the farm, running the grist and saw
mills, and also engaged in the coopering business.

He was a man of more than ordinary intelligence, and
his high sense of honor and integrity gained for him the
entire confidence of the people, as is evidenced by the
fact that his advice was constantly sought for, and his
services required in writing wills, deeds, and in the | trans-
action of other business.

In politics he was a Whig, and was elected to the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1808 and 1809.
In religion a Mennonite, and one of the leading members
of the Springfield church.

Vv. Ralph Funk, son of Henry Funk, was born A. D.,
1794, in Springtown, Bucks Co., Pa. While at home with
his father he was occupied in the milling business, He
waa united in marriage with Nancy Kaufman Dec. 9, 1817.
They lived on their farm near Bethlehem, in Northamp-
ton Co., Pa. Here were born to them the following nine
children: Samuel, Elizabeth, William, Cyrus, Mary Ann,
Barbara, Cecilia, Henry, Sarah. In the year 1834 Ralph
took a trip through the central and southern part of In-
diana, and the south-western, southern and central parts
of Ohio, in view of a location for a future home. He
started in company with Messrs. Bechtel and Barto. They
traveled by stage coach, and it required twelve days’ con-
tinnous journey going from Bethlehem to Indianapolis.
Here the stage route ended. They then walked forty
miles. Now Ralph purchased a fine riding horse, and a
few days after, separating from his companions, he made
the remainder of his journey alone.

* Returning home after an,absence of several weeks,
he sold their farm, and in the autumn of 1835 again
went to Wayne Co., Ohio, purchased a cultivated farm
situated three miles south of Wooster, the couaty seat,
consisting of 260 acres (on which was a flouring mill), at
a cost of $7,500, after which he returned home again.

He made preparations to move with his family on the
first day of April, but a deep snow having fallen, he was
detained until the 18th day of April, 1836, Their young:
est child was now eleven weeks old, He started with one
large covered wagon (commonly called a dry land
schooner), drawn by four large horses, and another
wagon drawn by two horses, He with his wife and smaller
children rode in a comfortable two horse carriage. They
carried provisions, and putting up at the taverns on the
way, cooked their own food. This being the custom, most
taverns had the conveniences for this purpose.

His brother, Kaufman Funk, went with him, but soon
after returned to Pa. The expense of moving was $100,
George Bechtel also moved his family in company with
Ralph, and bought an adjoining farm, where he spent the
remainder of his life. It took them 21 days to make the
journey.

Ralph then followed milling, and with the help of his
sous, the farming business. There being no market in
Wooster, they drew their produce to Fulton and Massillon,
the trip taking two or three days. Their four youngest
children were born here: Matilda, Sophia Malinda, Kauf-
man, Maria Isabella. :

Ralph and his wife were members of the Mennonite
church. While he lived in Ohio the nearest church of
their persuasion was ten miles distant, where they occa-
sionally attended services. They both had strong consti-
tutions, good health, and led temperate, moral, honest,
Christian lives, and imparted these same good qualities
to their children and grandchildren; for which give God
the glory.

Ralph Funk died in March, 1846, and was buried in the
graveyard adjoining his farm. This farm and mill were
then sold, and Nancy Funk bought a smaller farm in the
same county, ten miles west of Wooster, and near the
church they formerly attended. Here she, with her
younger children, lived; her son William farming the
place until she died, Dec. 23, 1850, and was buried in the
graveyard by the church.

The farm was then sold, and the estate divided among
the children. The younger children found homes with
the older married ones,

‘‘DiED.—On the morning of the 17th of April, 1859, of
typhoid fever, Mrs. Sarah Hartman, consort of Mr. C. C.
Hartman, in the 24th year of her age.

Seldom has the pen been required to memorize a
character around which clusters a brighter collection of
the virtues sometimes permitted to adorn hamanity.
Seldom has an individual united in herself so many of
those graces of the sprit, which are pecullarly the gift
of Deity. We feel, when recurring to her who is thus
stricken low in our midst, that language is powerless to
do justice to our conception of the good, the beautiful,
and the true, as they were personated in the various
exhibitions of her life. The wife affectionate, devoted,
and tender, the lady always alive to the amenities of
social life; the companion, social, instructive; the friend,
kind and sympathizing. When the eye which has beamed
with the light of intelligence and love no longer emits its
kindly rays; when the voice is hushed in the silence of
death, and the grave hides the inanimate form from our
view, the lineaments of character stand forth in their
mental daguerreotype, clear in the sunlight of memory,
and the moral beauty which encircled like a halo of glory -
the spirit of our friend, becomes brighte+ in our realiza-
tion of eternity. The death of Mrs. Hartman has caused
a chasm in our midst which cannot easily be filled; it is
felt in our whole community, and the deepest and kindest
sympathies have been called forth and tendered to the
bereaved husband and child. Communicated.”

Diep.—On the evening of May 11, 1859, at the reai-
dence of Daniel Yarnell, in Napoleon, Ohio, of typhoid
fever, Mr. Charles C. Hartman, in the 26th year of his
age. Inthe North West of April 20, was a notice of the
death of Mrs, Sarah Hartman, of typhoid fever, and by
the above announcement it will be seep that her husband
ha: fallen a victim to the same disease, and followed his
beloved wife tothe tomb. An infant child, too young to
realize its loss, has been left without a
. “Father's nurturing hand, a mother’s tender care,

To ope the young lips, and teach the infant prayer.”

He was then an orderly in rank, They moved south into
Kentucky and Tennessee, and were in the battle near
Murfreesboro, Tenn., whence he writes the following:

“Head Quarters, 24 Brigade, 2d Div,

In the field, Jan. 1, 1862,

My Dear Sister:—Now that we are settled, and?
the excitement is over, I will try to inform you of
a few affairs which I think will be of interest to you. In
the first place I must Say that I am thankful to God for His
mercies, You have undoubtedly heard of the battle, and you
are perhaps uneasy about my welfare. In reply to this T.
can say that Iam in good health, and by this time in pretty
good spirits, I was in the thickest of the battle and did
not get a touch by a ball; how I ever got out in this way I
cannot say, for I did not think the bullets few far enough
apart to miss a man. Iam very sorry to say we had to
fall back immediately after the attack was made. We
were overpowered by ten times our number; one whole
corps was thrown on our two brigades; but after giving
back some distance, and taking a new Position, we
checked the enemy’s column, and afterwards repulsed
them. I will now try and give you an account of our
Proceedings since leaving Nashville, and if you will let
the rest of the relatives read it, you will do me a favor,,
as I have not time at present to write many letters.

We left Nashville on the day after Christmas;
marched south on the turnpike through a drenching rain,
and having to fight the enemy all the way, made very
slow progress. We reached a village about 7 P.M.,, and
went intocamp. Inthe night we received another very
heavy shower of rain, which made the gruund (with the
exception of the pike) almost impassable. We started at
7AM. that morning in advunce. We had moved but a
little way when we came in sight of the enemy. Our
cavalry opened fire, and had quite a skirmish. Fire was
also opened from artillery, which soon dislodged the
rebels who were Posted on bluffs on each side of the road,

but we still moved on slowly, feeling our Way as we went,
and every now and then having a brush with the rebels,
After the rain was over there arose a dense fog so that



============================================================

we had to stop and wait for it toclear. Our brigade was
during this time deployed inorder of battle, asthere were
signs of the enemy’s presence in force. The fog cleared
in about an hour, and we received orders to advance,
which we did, carefully guarding against any dodge the
enemy might choose to play. We soon came in sight of
them again, when they opened on us with two pieces of
artillery, posted on the right of the road, on a high bluff.
Our battery was brought into position on the left of the
road, also on a bluff, and opened fire. This was too much
for them, so they soon pulled stakes and le!t. We imme-
diately moved forward and occupied their ground. Here
we came in sight of a small village—Tryune—which the
rebels still held. Our battery was placed in position and
commenced shelling the town, which soon made the rebels
seek other quarters. We were now to good position,
as the hill upon which we were stationed comman ‘ed the
country for a considerable distance. We waited here a
few moments and receiving no reply, moved forward,
calculating to occupy the village. Our movement was as
. rapid as possible, and but slow at that, for the ground
was so soft that it was impossible to move fa-ter than a
slow walk. When we reached the edge of the villaze, the
enemy opened on us again, with artiliery, Orders were
sent immediately to advance and charge the battery, but
it could not be done, as the men were entirely fagged out.
The rebels gave usa heavy fire of grape and canister,
but it had no effect at all, although we were within easy
range. We rested under fire and then advanced, hut the
enemy, seeing the game, again fled. We pursued them
for about'a mile and went into camp. Here we lay the
next day; were then in a westerly direction from Mur-
freesboro, On the 29th we started for Murfreesboro,
coming across from Tryune on a dirt road, we arrived on
the Nashville and Murfreesboro turnpike about 7P.M,,
and went into camp. We were too close to the enemy to
have camp-fires, therefore we did as best we couid with-
out cooking. Next morning we moved forward again and
took a position on the right of our Hine in a southerly
direction from Murfreesboro. Our movement was slowly
made as the advance guard were all the, while contesting
the enemy. We reached our position about dusk, our
pickets being in sight of the others. Gen, Davis’ division,

which was on our left, was engaged by the enemy.

There had beena rebel battery shelling his line all day --

long, and when we came up Gen. Kirk ordered our battery
into position and to commence firing. The movement
was executed with great promptness, and at the second
fire the rebels picked up and left. They were then tak- -
ing another position, when our battery gave them another
round and disabled them entirely. Our line being by this
time posted we retired, but little rest did we get, for the
' pickets were constantly firing on one another. In the
morning the whole command was under arms before day-
light,-and remained so until after daylight, when part of
the battery horses were taken to water. No sooner was
this done than the enemy appeareé in great numbers,
They moved up with a front equal toa battalion in line,
and seven regiments deep. Our battery opened fire with
grape and canister and the infantry poured a volley of
musketry, seldom excelled, but produced no visible effect
on their heavy column, as they advanced on a double
quick. They then poured a volley into us which made
everything ring. Our men were compelled to fall back
as we had buta single line; the battery could not be
removed on account of ‘the horses being killed. The
rebels were now within twenty-five yards of us, the men
of the battery stood until some of them were bayoneted.
We fell back in the best order possthle, losing many men
and officers, The next position was taken in an open
field, which place we again held until we could almost see
the whites of their eyes. Here I heard that Gen. Kirk
was wounded and his horse killed, so I went back again,
and found two men carrying him. I asked whether he
wanted my horse, he said he did, I dismounted and
helped him to mount. By this time we were between two
fires, our own and the enemy's which was not more than
ten rods from us. The General got out safely, but how I
got out without a wound, I cannot say, for the balls came
just like hail. The General ie now in Nashville, doing
well, What was left of our brigade fell back again
across the open field into the edge of a wood and formed
again. Here we checked the enemy for the first time,
but they soon overpowered us again and drove us. By
this time they had turned our battery upon us, and just
made the shells ring. We fell back through the wood tn


============================================================

very good order, the enemy still following us, When we
reached the reserve of our forces we repulsed and drove
the enemy back again, but not near to our old point.
The brigade was again formed under Col, J. B. Dodge and
took position which we held that night and the next day.
Here you can see how we spent our New Year's day.
There was heavy skirmishing all day on New Year, and
in the evening one of the heaviest battles of the war
was fought on the left of our lines. The killed in our
brigade will amoun: to about 125, The wounded and miss-
ing will amount to about 900.

We lay on the field until the 7th of January,*then
moved where we now are, five miles south of Murfrees-
boro, on the Selbyville turnpike. It has rained most of
the time since the battle, and we have had but little to
eat, nevertheless, we are thankful it is no worse.

Jan. 9.—I am in good spirits this morning, owing to
the brightness of the weather. I hope you are well. I
know not how I can send this letter, ag there is but little
mail at present. Not having time to write more, I will
close. Iremain your brother,

KAUFMAN,

In the year 1862 they marched through a great part
of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, having
frequent battles with the enemy. His brother Henry,
though in the same army, did not meet him until Sept. 28,
1864, when they spent two nights together, their firsi
meeting in eleven years, and the last time they saw each
other until Kaufman was on his death bed and could not
speak, Henry says, ‘‘We may well be proud of Kaufman,
for his whole regiment is proud of him.” Kaufman re-
ceived a commission as captain, in April, 1865, and then
was granted a furlough of fourteen days before taking
the command. His official signature now was: K. Funk,
Captain and Topographical Engineer, 24 Brigade, lst
Division, 4 A.C, ’

During our war the Catholics under the French invaded
the Republic of Mexico, committing great depredations
there, and cruelly murdered many of the army of the
Republic, They anticipated conquering the inhabitants
of Mexico, and then progressing into thé United States
with their forces, (they thought by this time our forces

would have been exhausted, and would be an easy prey
‘for them). This was an insult to our government as a
Republic.

Our difficulties at home being brought to a close in
the fall of 1865, our Secretary of War (Stanton), issued
orders to the French government to withdraw their
troops from Mexico, or he would send his forces there to
drive them out, and to affirm this statement he sent an
army into Texas, along the border line, there to remain
in reserve until ordered to proceed farther. (Capt. K.
Funk was one in the army detailed to go there.) But the
French seeing this, speedily withdrew their troops, and
the difficulty was then brought toa termination. In the
latter part of December, 1865, Kaufman was given the
commission of Colonel, and honorably discharged from
the service. He returned home to spend Christmas with
his friends in Wooster, Ohio.

Like many of our young soldiers who served the gov-
ernment, he now had no business education, therefore
most of the remainder of his life he was occupied as a
traveling . ‘esman,

He united with the Baptist church Aug. 6, 1868. Mrd.

Chicago, Ill., and after a week’s illness died there, Oct.
21, 1878, and was buried in the Wooster (Ohio) cemetery.

In reading this very short biographical sketch of
Ralph and Nancy Kaufman Funk and their descendants,
we find the number of thelr offapring to be as follows:

Ralph Funk's family descendants are a noble minded,
worthy class of people. Their educational advantages
were perhaps somewhat limited, but by their industry
and good management, they applied their acquirements
to good purpose. They are all temperate, law-abiding
citizens, free from vicious habits, drunkenness, and im-
moral tendencies. While none of them may be considered
wealthy, yet they all have a competency, and have a
disposition to take care of themselves.
In conclusion, I will say that the writing of this
family history has been to me a source of great pleasure.

native place in December, 1880. He received his prelimi-
nary education in the schools of his native place, the
High school of Sellersville, and the State Normal school
at West Chester, Pa. His ambition from a boy was to
become a minister. And thus desiring a more thorough
preparation for the study of theology, he entered upon a
course of study in Ureinus College, which he completed in
the spmmer of 1886. A call from Brownbach’s charge,
Chester Co., Pa., was waiting for him. He accepted the
call and was ordained to the gospel miuistry and installed
pastor of the charge June 3, 1888. His labors were greatly
blessed to the ingathering of many souls, He was called

Mrd. Jacob Beidler, also of Bucks Co., Pa., Apr. 28, 1844,
For about two years before his marriage, Mr. Beidler had
resided at Springfield, Ill. In the fall of 1844, they moved
from. Springfield to Chicago, making the trip with
teams, through an unbroken and in many places an
almost impassable prairie, a distance of about one
hundred and fifty miles, Her experiences in ‘the new
city of the lake, with those of her husband, would make a
volume of deep and practical interest to the present gen-
eration. Through trials and self-denials, patiently and
quietly she lived the life God had appointed to her, and
God blessed her in it, until surrounded by the abundant
comforts of this life, anda family of four sons and one
danghter, who did all that love and kindness could suggest
to make her last days peaceful and happy, she calmly fell
asleep, and went to her rest, as we trust, in the house of
™many mansions, where all tears are wiped away, where
there is no more pain, nor sorrow, nor death, and where
every redeemed soul with the poet may sing:

“There I shall bathe my weary soul,
In seas of everlasting reat,

And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast.”

She was in the true sense of the word a model
wife and mother, a true help-meet to her husband,
careful and economical housewife, a keeper at bome, and
manifested a rare spirit of patience, kindness, and for-
bearance. She was the mother of nine children. Two
died in infancy; the dead body of John was found in the
lake in July 1881; how he came to his death is a
mystery which probably eternity alone will reveal, Will-
iam died of paralysis in September, 1897, and the hus-
band and father of the family passed away six months
later, to the day. She was universally beloved and re-
spected, and in her death we mourn her as one whom we

M. ‘.eidler was born in Bedminster Twp., Bucks Co.,
Pa., Dec. 20, 1815; died Mar. 15, 1898, in his 83d year.
Res., Chicago, Ill. Presby. Children: Joseph, Augustus,
William, Francis, Emma, John, David, George.

Mr. Beidler was one of the early settlers, and also one
of the pioneer lumbermen of Chicago, Ill. He grew up
on his father’s farm, enjoyed only limited educational
advantages, learned the carpenter and cabinet making
trade, and was early inured to hard work. His experi-
ences while following his trade as a country carpenter
were remarkable. In 1842 he went to Springfield, Ill, and
engaged in the mercantile business. After two years he
sold out, married, and in August of the same year (1844),
moved to Chicago, where he resided to the time of his
death. Mr. Beidler enjoyed a high degree of temporal
prosperity. The Lord prospered him in all his ways. The
saying of Solomon, Prov. 22:29, was, if indeed not
literally, yet figuratively, fully verified in the life of

‘Jacob Beidler. While he was diligent and energetic, and
applied himself closely to his business, no one could say
that he was parsimonious or avaricious, What he had
came to him as from the open hand of the bountiful Giver
of every good and perfect gift. Hein many instances
manifested a degree of benevolence and disinterested
acquiescence to circumstances and fortune that was re-
markable and highly commendable.

One morning he came down to his office, and, as was
his custom, took up the morning paper and began to read.
While thus engaged hia book-keeper came into the room
and informed him of the fact that his lumber mill at
Muskegon, Mich., had burned away the previous night
(the loss being over 916,000). The news made so slight an
impression upon his mind that he only gave a brief, com- .
monplace reply, and read on as if nothing had happened.
He accumulated a large fortune, but with a truly gener-
ous impulse in his soul, he let others also share in his
prosperity. Many young men were helped into business,
and started in life by his aid and direction, A number of
business firms were established and prospered by the
means supplied by the unselfish hand of Jacob Beidler.

He also gave generously to the poor and needy in
different ways, and paid thousands upon thousands of
dollars to churches and other benevolent purposes,
Among mauy other liberal douations he gave 85,000 to
the maintaining of a free bed in tke Presbyterian Hos-
pital of Chicago; $9,000 to wipe outa church debt; $16,666
to the purchase of a Y, M.C. A. building on the West
side, and $30,000 for the endowment of a professorship
and the building of a memorial cottage, in memory of his
son John Betdler, at Lake Forest University, Lake Forest,
Ill, In fact Jacob Beidler indirectly laid the foundation
stone that gave to the Mennonite church the church
papers published at Elkhart, Ind., and the extensive pub-
lishing house now located there. To him surely belongs
a share of the credit that the originators of this enter-
prise deserve, :

Hundreds can testify to his kindness and generosity,
Faithful as a friend, true to every trust, a character
above reproach, outspoken in his convictions, and un-
flinching in his defense of the right, he lived hig life, and
in a good old age, like a shock of corn fully ripened for
the harvest, he was gathered to hia fathers. God bless
his memory. He was sick about a week. Funeral services
were held at the residence on Thursday, Mar, 17, 1898, and
were conducted by Rev. Frank DeWitt Talmage, of the
Jefferson Park Presbyterian church, Chicago, assisted by
Dr. Marquis, of the McCormick Theological Seminary,
Remarks were also made by Dr. McClure, of Lake Forest
University and Fernando Jones who had known Mr. Beid-
ler many years.

during the early part of 1862 and the summer of 1863,
spent two terms at the Excelsior Normal Institute, at
Carversville, Bucks Co., Pa. He taught in the schools of
his native county, from 1862 to 1865. In the spring of 1865
he gave up that vocation and went to Chicago, lll., and
engaged in the lumber business. On the 28th of Sept., of
the same year, he purchaseda scholarship in the Eastman
Business College of that city, and took a commercial
Course, attending in the evening only. After four years’
residence in Chicago, he determined to engage in business
for himself, and accordingly in the spring of 1869, located
at Chillicothe, Mo., where he opened a lumber yard, and
commenced business on his own account. On the 15th of
January following (1870), he was married to Annie K.
Stover, daughter of Jonas Stover, of E. Rockhill Twp.,
Bucks Co., Pa. He afterwards became connected with
the North Western Lumber Co., who had their mills at
Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and extensive yards at Hannibal,
Mo.; and on the 20th of April, 1880, moved with his family
from Chillicethe to Hannibal. Afterwards when the
duties of his position required him to be mostly in the
neighborhood where the mills of the company were lo-
cated, he found it more economical and convenient to
have his family in that vicinity also, and accordingly, on
the 20th of July, 1885, he removed to Minneapolis, Minn.
He continued with the above firm eleven years, during
which time he gained with them the highest esteem and

respect, both for his conscientious business integrity and
his excellent qualifications for the work in which he was
engaged. In the spring of 1890 he severed his relations
with the N. W. Lumber Co., but the warm feeling of
esteem and respect which he had won for himself during
these extended business relations continued to the end
of his life.

He took an active part in the various civil, social, and
religious movements of the day, and was always ready
and willing to assist in all enterprises of public interest,
and held continuously positions of responsibility and
honor. Soon after bis removal to Chillicothe, in 1869, he
was elected superintendent of the Sunday school of the
Presbyterian church of that city, which position he held
until his removal to Hannibal in 1880. He was converted
and united with the Third Presbyterian church of Chicago
during the time of his residence there. In 1871 or 72 he
was elected elder of the First Presbyterian church of
Chillicothe. He was secretary of the school board of
that city, and through his influence was built the beauti-
ful new school building, costing from 245,000 to $50,000.
In 1875 he was also member of the city council, During
the last three years of his residence in Chillicothe he
was correspondent of the Globe Democrat, a Republican
paper of St. Louis. During the summer of 1890, after
severing his connection with the N. W. L. Co., he, with
A, Fiero, was appointed, by the lumber manufacturers of
the N. W., to inspect the system of grading employed by
the leading manufacturers of the north-west, and their
report was received with much favor and satisfaction.
After the completion of this commission, he became con-
nected with the T. B. Scott Lumber Co., of Merrill, Wis.,
and during a business trip through Illinois and Indiana,
he was taken sick with a severe pilious attack, and after
nearly a week of suffering in hotels, in Terre Haute, Ind.,
Chicago, Ill., and on the road, he reached his home in
Minneapolis, Minn., on the 224 of September. The disease
assumed a complicated form which resulted in blood
poisoning, and after three weeks more of intense suffer-
ing, which he bore with patience, he died on the 15th of
Oct., 1890, aged 48 years, 6 months and 2 days. Presby.

age Allen was sent by his father, who believed in a ‘more
liberal education, to the Mennonite Seminary at Wads-
worth, Ohio. He subsequently attended one term at
the Excelsior Normal Institute at Carversville, Pa., also
a teacher's term at West Chester State Normal School.
He taught school eleven terms at the following places in
order, viz.; Pipersville, Fretz Valley, Bedminsterville,
Deep Run, and Union, working on his father’s farm during
the summer months, In the fall of 1882, he accepted the
nomination of the Republican party as a candidate for
the State Legislature; but the party being in the minority
in that campaign, he was defeated with the rest of the
ticket. In 1883 the Second Mennonite church at Deep
Run called him to be their minister, and he was accord-
ingly ordained by Bishop Moses Gottshall, on Oct. 13, 1883,
as pastor of the same. Feeling the pressing need of an
English paper in the interest of his branch of the Menno-
nite church, he, with the aid of Rev. N. B. Grubb, pastor
of the church in Philadelphia, in 1885 began the publica-
tion of the Mennonite, which was accepted by the Eastern
District as one of the periodicals of the church. He was
eleven years associate editor of this publication. On Nov.
24, 1892, he was ordained to the office of bishop hy Rev.
W.S. Gotshall, assisted by Rev. J. S. Moyer, at Deep Run,
and has the spiritual oversight as pastor and bishop of
the Deep Run and Souderton churches, In February 1893
his pastoral field was enlarged by the call to the newly
organized church at Souderton, Montgomery Co., Pa,

Moyer, of Campden, Ont., Apr. 2, 1874. Mr. Rittenhouse
received a common school education, attending school in
the winter months, and as soon as he was old enough
worked on his father’s farm inthe summer. Before he
was quite seventeen he obtained a certificate to teach,
and on Jan, 1, 1870, took charge of his first school. For
over thirteen years he labored in the school room, till,
failing in health, he was compelled to seek other occupa-
tion. At the age of 22, while teaching a country school,
at the modest sum of $400 a year, he was married. Three
years later, he secured an appointment to a position in
the Central school of St. Catharines, Ont. After four
years of hard work, he was promoted to headmastership
of the school; but the unceasing labor, the close confine-
ment, and the loss of two of his children, so wore upon his
health that he resigned his position in 1883, to seek more
active out-door life.

During the same year he began the study of medicine,
and the next year removed to Chicago, where he received
his degree at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in
1886, and at once settled down in the same city to engage
in the practice of his profession,

Dr. Rittenhouse is Vice-President and Professor of
Obstetrics of the Chicago Summer School of Medicine,
now called the Illinois Medical College, of which he is one
of the founders. He is also President, and Professor of
Obstetrics of the Jenner idedical College of Chicago.

taught school for about ten years, and for twelve years
was employed in making surveys for making and publish-
ing county maps, mostly in Michigan. He later moved
to Emmons Co., North Dakota, where he has been en-
gaged for some years in farming.

In July 1889, he was appointed Deputy Clerk of the
District Court, for the reason that he understood the
German language. His part of the work was to do busi~
ness with the Russian German people that reside in Em-
mons Co., N. D., and which business consisted mainly of
taking final proofs and filings for land. The Russian
Germans greatiy appreciated the favor of having in the
office at the county seat, one who could converse and do
business with them in their own language, and interpret
and answer in German their German letters for them,
and they soon came to the conclusion to do what they
could to keep Mr. Gell in office at the county seat, and
they soon had an opportunity of acting upon their con-
clusion. In Sept. 1890, Mr. Geil was nominated by a vote
of 45 to 16 by the Republican county convention as a can-
didate for Register of Deeds, and in November of same
year was elected to that office by a majority of 140, hav.
ing received all the (150) Russian German votes, although
said Russian Germans were nearly all Democrats.

In January 1892, John F. Geil waa appointed a Notary
Public in and for Emmons, N. D., by the Governor of the
State. In the same year (1892) Mr. Geil was nominated
by acclamation as a candidate for Register of Deeds, for

Successful in business he enjoyed the unlimited confidence
and respect of the community in which he lived, so much
so that at the close of the war, which left the rebél
states without the protection of law and order of any
kind, the whole community insisted on his acting as
County Magistrate, which office he filled until recon-
struction of the state government was effected under
authority of Congress of U. S. It was well understood
all through the war that he was a Union man, but he did
not make himself obnoxtous by ill-judged intrusion of his
sentiments upon others in that section, where it could do
no good. Thus he was left alone during the war, except
that the armies of both sides encamped on his place at
Thoroughfare Gap repeatedly, and left neither fence nor
living thing of stock on the place. His losses in property
and money, caused by the war, amounted to about $40,000.

Sarah W. King, daughter of Capt. Henry King, of Cam-
den, N. J. *When twenty years of age [Ralph was con-
verted. Feeling his call to preach the Gospel to be from
the Lord, he spent some time in preparatory study at
Pennington Seminary. After serving as a supply under
the P, E., in April, 1849, he entered the New Jersey Con-
ference. His first appointment was to Asbury Circuit,
his own home. Upon the division of the Conference in
1857, he joined the Newark Conference, in which he re-
tained membership until his death.

He served many important charges during his active
ministry, among them First Church, at Rahway; Eliza-
beth Avenue Church, at Elizabeth; St. Paul’s, Franklin
Street, and Eighth Avenue Churches, in Newark; Simp-
son Church, Jersey City, and the church at Haverstraw,
N.Y. While pastor of the last named church, which he
served for three years, a remarkable revival of religion
occurred in which more than two hundred were converted,
one half of whom were heads of families.

In 1876 he was made Presiding Elder of the Elizabeth
District, in which office he served the full term of four
years with general satisfaction. His last charge was at
Verona, N. J., where in Oct., 1890, his health failed, In
1891 the Conference granted him a Supernumerary rela-
tion, and, with his family, he took up his residence in
Newark, N. J. In social life his warm heart and genial
manner always secured to him a cordial welcome. He
possessed the art of saying agreeable things without a
suspicion of flattery. He was a careful observer of men
and things, keeping well posted upon the affairs of the
world, and having rare insight in discerning the charac-
istics of men. Fis sterling piety impressed itself upon
all who knew him. He possessed a happy submission to
the divine wiii, acd was profoundly grateful for present
mercies, which marked the meekness of this man of God.
Such a spirit could not be other than a peace-maker, and
as such he frequently received the pledge that he wasa
child of God.

Mr. Arndt was, by the grace of God, well prepared to
die. During the last year of his life he spent much of
his time in carefully reading the Scriptures, observing
their personal application. He often spoke in public and
in private of the delight and profit he had ia this exer-
cise. Although always a man of prayer, during the last
year he spent more time than formerly in the closet with
the Lord. It was observed that while “reaching forth
unto those things which are before,” he became lese and
less interested in the affairs of this world, so that his
hand seemed already extended “‘for the prize of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus.” The record of a life de-
voted to the cause of his Master, a simple daily trust in
Jesus, and a steady faith in the precious promises of the
word of God were assurances that in the hour of his de-
parture it was well with hissoul. He who had promised
never to leave nor to forsake him was still with him
while passing through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

1. (Bish.) Henry Funck came to America and settled
at the Indian Creek, in Franconia Twp., Philadelphia,
now Montgomery Co., Pa., in the year 1719; he was then
ordained as the minister of the Franconia Mennonite
congregation, According to documents yet extant he
must have had a brother who did not come to America,
and whose name I was not able to ascertain. Buta son
by the name of Jacob Funk came, and on the 16th of
May, 1'34, took out a patent for one hundred and forty
acres of land, and six per cent. allowed for roads, &c.,
granted by the Honorable the Proprietors of Pennsyl-
vania, He was a nephew of the above named Henry
Funck. This patent is recorded in the Roll’s office at
Philadelphia, in Patent Book A, Vol. 6, page 311, etc.
This Jacob Funk, Sr., made his last will in writing, bear-
ing date May 15, 1756, and bequeathed to his son Jacob
Funk, Jr., all that tract of land mentioned above under
said patent. Hesays: ‘I appoint my loving friend and
cousin, Christian Funk, and my wife, Barbara Funk, as
my executors.” The will was probated June 14, 1756, and
is registered in Book K, page 407, at Philadelphia, anda
deed was given by the executors to Jacob Funk, Jr., dated
April 20, 1759, The above named will of Jacob Funk, Sr.,
is witnessed by Christian Meyer, Samuel Meyer and
Henry Funk. He had four children, viz.: two sons, Jacob
Funk, Jr., and Samuel Funk, and two daughters, Barbara
Funk and Maria Funk. His will reads as follows: :

also the fourth part of all fruit, the fodering and pastur-
ing of a Cow, to be kept as her own, and three pounds of
wool, all yearly, as long as she shall remain my widow.

Fourthly,—my land whereon I now dwell, viz.:—one
hundred and forty-one acres with all Buildings is hereby
given over to my son Jacob Funk, for two hundred and
Sixty pounds Current money of Pennsylvania so that my
son Jacob Funk, may hold the Said Land and plantation
for him, his heirs and inheritors, forever, And the Said
Land shall be paid for in manner and condition follow-
ing, as Iam yet, One hundred pounds in debt by Bond to

ately intu the hands of my Guardians Clear and without
any Cost, and the remaining One Hundred and Sixty
pounds shall remain unpaid without any interest as long
as my wife Barbara shall remain my widow, and in case
she sLall Marry again soon, Then it shall still remain un-
paid without interest untill my Son Samuel Funk arrives
to the age of Twenty one years.

Fifthly, As Ihave already given unto my eldest son
Jacob Funk, five pounds as his prior right and Twenty five
pounds more for a beginning and my daughter Barbara
has received Twenty five pounds in part of her Inherit-
ance. Therefore, my son Samuel, and my daughter Maria
each of them shall also have Twenty five pounds as soon
as they shall have occasion for it.

Sixthly.—It is my will that if my aaid widow Barbara
shall happen to get married again, then she shall have
the third part after all the Devices and Legacies are
first paid and she shall then have no more right to the
land.

Seventhly. It is my will that in case of Sickness,
Failing of Crops, and misfortunes, It should happen that
my said wife should not find Sufficient what is given to
her out of the Land for her maintainance, Then in euch
case she shall have to make use of so much of the Estate
as she shall bave Occasion for, but then it must be
charged to her and afterwards deducted out of her third
whenever the Division is made.

Eighthly,—It is my will that in case my wife shall
marry again, and if then she hath received her thirds,
and my son Samuel then be of the age of Twenty One
Years, then they shall Divide their two parts into four
equal parts Amongst my four children and the one is to
have as much as the other, and in case One of the young-
est or both die under age, Then their parts are to be
equally dividend among the Survivors of them, But if
my wife shall remain my widow then no Division is to be
made; not till she is dead and honestly Burried, andthen
the whole estate is to be dividend into equal shares and
the one is to be used like the other.

Ninethly. One thing necessary. I call to mind my
said wife shall have my New Bible, my Martyr Book, one
of my new hymn books, One of my Golden Apples, (a

hymn Book) and one of my Psalm Books, and these books
she shall have as long as she lives,

Tenthly.— .t is my will and I do hereby Constitute and
appoint my Dear Friend and Cousin Christian Funk, and
my beloved wife Barbara, to be the Guardians or Executors
of this my last Will and Testament, and I do hereby em-
power my said Guardians or Executors, Christian Funk and

Jacob Funk, and to his heirs and inheritors, for ever, a
full Deed for my Said Land, and I do hereby revoke all
Wills and Testaments by me heretofore made, and de-
clare and acknowledge only this to be my last Will and

JACOB FUNK. [SEAU].
Proven April 16, 1816.
Registered in Book 4, page 221, at Norristown, Mont-
gomery county, Pa.

The Tomb Yara mentioned in the above will is a
small yard surrounded by a stone wall, inside of which is
built a vault in which rests the body of General Murray,
a British officer, who was killed in the battle at German-
townin1777, At that time the British army had taken
possession of Jacob Funk’s farm and took all his horses
and his stock and otherwise ruined much of his property.
and cleaned out the place-so completely that he was
obliged to buy a yoke of oxen to commence farming
again, and in spite of his great reverses he again pros-
pered very substantially. No indemnity was ever paid to
Jacob Funk for these depredations, probably for the
reason that he never asked for it.

There is another bit of Revolutionary history at-
tached to the history of Jacob Funk while he was the
pastor of the Mennonite church at Germantown in 1777.
It was from behind a stone wall which separated the
Mennonite burying ground from the main street, while
General Agnew,a British general, was returning from
the battle just before sunset and riding down a steep hill
in front of the meeting house and turning his head, look-
ing at the silvery clouds just before sunset, that he was
fired upon by a half grown boy sitting behind the said
wall. The officer was mortally wounded and soon died
and is buried in the lower burying ground, now Hood's
cemetery, Germantown. The name of the perpetrator
was carefully guarded by those who knew. Hans
Boyer, a half witted fellow of that day, claimed the
credit of the deed, but it is said to have not rightfully be-
longed to him.

who, at Germantown, Pa., Mar. 26, 1807, by the Rev. Hel-
fenstein, pastor of the First Germantown Presbyterian
Church, was married to Catharine Kelter, a grand-
daughter of Jacob Funk, Jr., the Mennonite minister.

of Jesse Layton Large’s life has been passed in the Far
West as a successful teacher in the public schoole. He is
also well known as a Shakespearean scholar and reader.

their married life were spent in Germantown, Philadel-
phia. Thence they removed to West Alexander, Wash-
ington county, Pa., where they lived and died, loved and
respected in life and mourned at death by the whole
community in which they spent their philanthropic and
hospitable lives. Those who asked help were never
turned away empty, and the homeless were sheltered and
fed and comforted. They lived the life of the just, and
their departure from this life corresponded with their
beautiful lives, and a triumphant departure it was.
Verily the mourners that stood around their deathbed
could exclaim with the prophet of old, “Our loved ones!
Our loved ones! The chariot of Israel and the horsemen
thereof!” Shining in robes immaculate, bearing the
trust they kept so well, they passed beyond the crystal
gate into the light ineffable. Children: William, Mary,
Tacie, Elizabeth, Annie, Sarah, Caroline, Martha, Susan.

Vi, William Dickey, mrd. Margaret Rogers. William
Dickey, the first born of Nathaniel O’Dickey, inherited
from hie parents their love of knowledge, their patriot-
ism and philanthrophy. He was a warm friend of educa-
tion, a teacher by nature and profession. He possessed
much of the material of which heroes are made. Solid,
stalwart, brave, he wasa scholar in a broad sense. He
studied night and day, year by year, with untiring dili-
gence and the fruits of such study were always ripe for
the benefit of those who desired to tastethem. He loved
truth and principle more than men, was ever ready to
stand up against meanness and wrong. He was honored
and revered and was first in the hearts of the people of
Washington county, Pa., where his memory will Jong be
cherished, They left no children.

The last three branches of the Funk family are re-
markably connected, and will be of interest to the de-
acendants of those families. Therefore the following
sketch is prepared, viz.: : .


============================================================
PAGE 731
============================================================

— 667 —

Esther Kolb married Samuel Funk. Matthias Kolb
married Ann Funk. Daniel Kulb married Elizabeth Funk.
The three Kolbs were the children of one family, namely
that of Dillman Kolb and Wilhelmina Rittenhouse.
Dillman was a son of Martin Kolb, who came from Man-
heim (Pfalz) and settled in Germantown in 1707, and in
1709 married Magdalena Van Sintern and moved to Skip-
pack and was one of the first Mennonite ministers there,
and was a brother to Dillman Kolb, of Salford, who su-
perintended and compared proofsheets of the Ephrata
edition of the Martyrs Mirror, and grandfather of An-
drew Ziegler, of Salford, a bishop in the Mennonite
churches at Salford and Germantown.

The mother of these three Kolbs was, as above stated,
Wilhelmina Rittenhouse, a first cousin to David Ritten-
house, the astronomer, and a daughter of Henry Ritten-
house and Susanna Wool, who moved to Worcester,
Montgomery Co., Pa., in 1727, and gave the ground fora
school house, meeting house and burying ground, now the
Methatchen Mennonite meeting house, and was a son of
Nicolaus or Klaas Rittenhouse, a Mennonite minister in
Germantown from 1710 to 1734, a son of Willem Ritten-
house, who came from Amsterdam, Holland, and settled at
Germantown in 1688, and in 1690 built the first papermill
in America, and was also the tirst Mennonite minister and
first bishop in said church in America. He had charge of
the Germantown Mennonite congregation until he died
in 1708,

The three Funks were the children of Jacob Funk,
Jr., of Cheltenham. Montgomery Co., Pa., son of Jacob
Funk, Sr., of Franconia, where Jacob Funk, Jr., resided,
and was ordained to the ministry in the Franconia con-
gregation in 1765, and .n 1774 moved to Cheltenham and
connected himself witl the ‘Jennonite church at Ger-
mantown, where he serve as their pastor till his death
in 1816.

All the children of Dillman Kolb and Wilhelmina
Rittenhouse were: Esther Kolb, married Samuel Funk,
April 29, 1788. Magdalena Kolb, born May 23, 1746; died
June 29, 1822. Married Isaac Cassel, Aug. 13, 1801. No
issue. He was a minister in the Skippack Mennonite
congregation. He had issue by first marriage. Wil-
helmina Kolb married Dirck Keyser. Henry Kolb mar-

ried Esther Metz. Daniel Kolb, born in 1766; died in 1816.
Married Elizabeth Funk, born Nov. 20, 1768: died Dec. 23,
185]. Martin Kolb, unmarried. Isaac Kolb, born ——:
died in 1828; went to Maryland. Married Miss —— Kiser.
Matthias Kolb, born Dec, 16, 1759; died Mar. 9, 1837. Mar-
ried Ann Funk, born May 10, 1767; died May 20, 1849, The
descendants of all the above named families are de-
scendants of the Rittenhouse family, as well as the de-
scendants of the Jacob Funk family.

I also find the following in the Pennsylvania ar-
chives: ‘Anno Regni Tertio Georgii Regis (1729), chap.
ceexii. Jacob Funk was naturalized in 1729, with a num-
ber of other Germans, under the following:

‘Whereas, Divers Protestants who were subjects to
the Emperor of Germany, a Prince in Amity with the
Crown of Great Britain, transported themselves and
estates into the Province of Pennsylvania between the
years 1700 and 1718.” Which would bring the arrival of
Jacob Funk, Sr., into Pennsylvania prior to 1718.

“Catherine unk. was born et Beaver Creek, Wash-
ington county, Md.,. the 24th day of August, 1797, and
died Wednescay, Dec. 24, 1903, aged 108 years, 4 months
and 2days. Her ancestrai line i» noted for longevity,
although none of her ancestors, »9 far as known, can
rival her own in that respect. Her father, Samuel
Funk, lived to the ripe old age of 91 years. Her mother,

lived to be about 86 years of age, and her grandmother
was an octogenarian when she died. Very nearly half
her own life was spent in the home of her childhood, and
she did not come west until 1845, or 65 years ago. While
still bearing her maiden name, Catherine Funk, she left
her Maryland home, in company with John Bovey and
family, who were moving to this vicinity, and started to
make her home with her brother, Samuel Funk, who had
moved west some time before, locating in Pine Creek
township, She was married to Jacob Rice, who was a
native of the same section as herself and his first wife,
Mary Roland, having passed away three years after they
had made their home in the new settlement.

“The marriage of Catherine Funk to Mr. Rice was the
beginning of a busy household life of her own, Aunt
Kitty, the name by which she has been familiarly known
throughout the region around, had no children of her
own, but she became a thoughtful and devoted mother to
the children of her husband. They made their home
three miles north of the village of Mt. Morris, Ill, which
continued to be their abode until hie death’ in 1870, at the
age of 85, She remained on the old homestead 20 years

longer, but for the last 10 years resided in Mt. Morris —

with her atep-son, the late Hou. Isaac Rice, whose name
is honored throughout this part of the county.

“Aunt Kitty often told her friends of the interesting
incidents of her first trip west. On leaving her native
state, this trip was made by stage as far as Wheeling,
Va,, thence down the Ohio and up the Mississippi and
Illinois rivers as far as Peru, near Peoria; thence she
traveled overland to Oregon, the county seat of Ogle
county. This now beautiful and thriving city then had
only a handful of people, scarcely more than 200 souls;
and the widely famous college town of Mt. Morris was
then a hamlet numbering perhaps 50 persons. Among
the incidents of life here in that early time were the oc-
casiona! rides to Chicago by ox-cart, a trip she repeated-
ly made; her errand being to conclude the purchases for
the year. On one occasion when the oxen were turned
out to grass in the evening, one of the two teams strayed
away, and in the morning could not be found, far or near.
They were compelled to hitch one rig behind the other,
and make their journey drawn bya single team. The


============================================================

— 1709 —

runaways were subsequently found to have made their
way home, swimming Rock river on their return.

“At the period of Aunt Kitty’s early visits, there
was no danger of being lost in Chicago. The town was
too small for that. Her annual visits there were for the
purpose of laying in a supply of clothing for the severe
western winters. Chicago was a very unattractive place
in those times, the business district towards the court
house being in the swav.p, and the Michigan avenue lake
front, over towards the present Illinois Central depot a
line of sandy knolle. She remembered distinctly wan-
dering along the Lake Michigan beach, picking up shells
and pebbles,

“The fact that the home of Mrs, Rice was in and near
the college town of Mt. Morris for more than half a
century, presiding over the home of a piominent mem-
ber of the community, gave her the personal acquaint-
ance of many young people who afterwards came to
fame and high station. Her roof always sheltered a
generous hospitality. Among those who have sat at her
table may be mentioned Gen. W. H. L. Wallace, Martin
P. Sweet, Thomas J. Turner, E. B. Washburne, Shelby
M. Cullom, Gen, John A. Rawlins and many others, some
of whom were students of Rock River Seminary. Mrs.
Rice was always industrious and frugal, but the needy
were never denied foodor care, She was almoat as widely
known in portions of Maryland around her old home, as
in this vicinity.

“Aunt Kitty’s memory of events of her early years
was remarkably clear to the last. Many stirring events
transpired near her home at that time. The excitement
caused by the war of 1612, the burning of the national
capitol, the Bladeneberg race, etc., were as fresh in her
memory as though of recent occurrence. She could trace
the family connections of all who lived in the vicinity of
her home, many of the families being represented in the
older settlers of the region about Mt. Morris, She cred-
ited to her cheerfulness, her never-flagging industry and
abstewious habits, the marked favor extended to her in
her long life. For many years of her life she was fond of
smoking, indulging moderately, but for the last fifteen
_ years or longer she strictly refrained, She was not able

to read her favorite book, the Bible, for a number of


============================================================
PAGE 776
============================================================

— 110 —

years because of the impairment of her eyesight. She
was able to distinguish general form and color, but noth-
ing more. Her hearing continued good, Like her father
and grandfather before her, she was a devout member
of the Mennonite faith, but since coming where there
are few of that persuasion, she worshipped with other
denominations with which she was most in sympathy.
Although having her own views as to religious forms,
etc., the spirit of the gospel was always the main thing
with her, .

“Aunt Kitty wae the contemporary of every great
event in our national history since the Revolutionary
war. Her life spanned all American presidents, from
Washington to McKinley. She lived during the three
wars of our nation under the constitution, including the
last war with Great Britain, the war with Mexico, and
the great Civil war. She and her husband held toa
faith that eschewed war, and excited of its followers
everything in act or conduct that could ald to banish
war; but they gave their active sympathy and good
cheer to the soldiers who fought to preserve the union.

“Aunt Kitty's grandfather came to America about
1748, early in his married life. He came from the wine
districts on the Rhine, being impelled to leave Germany
on account of the conscription and his religious com-
punction in regard to war. On the way across the At-
lantic they were nearly three months on the passage,
and were near to a famine from running out of supplies.
Her grandfather settled near Hagerstown, then a wilder-
ness. The settlement there was often in peril from the
Indians, the times being very alarming during the French
and Indian war and during the Revolution. One season
nine families lived ina barn all summer. At one time,
when the Indians came, they all fied for Fredericktown, 20
miles away, leaving a dinner cooking. They never knew
who got that dinner.

“Her grandfather gave her father a wild farm and
her father and mother prepared it for cultivation, work-
ing together in grubbing out the undergrowth and small
trees, Later her father bought the mill, At one time
it was so full of grain that the gable buret. That pre-
sented a grave emergency. He called in all the neigh-
bors, with their teams, and moved the grain to the barns


============================================================
PAGE 777
============================================================

— 711 —

of the vicinity, The condition of the mill was found too
serious to remedy and it was torn down, being complete-
ly rebuilt between April and October, a large force being
employed for that purpose. The millwrights were put to
work in the forest to prepare the timbers and the masons
in the quarries to get out the stone, They had to care
for all the force at the house. Her mother was an inva-
lid from rheumatism at this time. The ouly help Aunt
Kitty had was a girlof eleven years. There was abso-
lutely no domestic help to be had. She did all the work,
her baking of the bread for the table consuming twenty
barrels of flour during the six months, There were twen-
ty-eivht hungry men to be fed. Breakfast had to be
ready at sun-rise, and the men from the quarries did not
get in for their supper until sun-down. A friend who
dropped in to see them during that period sid he ‘would
not give much for Kitty when the mill wa: done,’ think-
ing it a killing work ; but she outlived them all.

“The farmer of that time raised quite an amount of
wheat and corn, some rye and barley, and a little oats.
He waz also a stock raiser, keeping cattle, hogs and
sheep, He grew flax for making all the linen for family
use, and out of the flax and wool were prepared the fibres
and the thread for the weaving of the garments for both
men and women. Many beautiful white linen goods were
made, but it gave the women of the household a life of
incessant labor. They were never idle, not stopping from
their day's work until nine o'clock in the evening, The
mere spinning was only a small part of the work of keep-
ing the men folke and women folks in.clothes, providing
the bedding, the table linen, etc. The grain was all cut
by hand with the sickle. She had often seen twenty men
in the fleld, going through the standing wheat and laying
itin bundles, They had some wagons in those days but
many more carts.

“The young people were not without their enjoy-
ments in her day, although their life was well filled with
bard labor. Most families made apple butter a promi-
nent thing of their diet. The young people used to get
together in bees, prepare the apples and make them up
into the apple butter. They had no Sunday echools in
those days, When they came home from church the
father would gather the children together after dinner

to see how much they could reriember of the sermon.
After they had finished that catechizing they were al-
lowed to play, this being about the only respite of the
week, She remembered her grandfather well, who died
in 1804, and her grandmother, who died in 1807,

“She recalled the firat coffee they ever had. Her
father brought it from Fredericktown. ‘Here's some-
thing they call coffee,’ she heard him say. ‘Idon’t know
whether they make soup of it cr cook it with meat!’ was
his wandering comment. An English lady who knew cof-
fee, pronounced it good and showed them how to prepare
it. She browned the coffee in the skillet, and beat it in
the mortar as they did their spices. Her father tried a
mouthful of it, but immediately went to the door and
spit it out, having a very poor idea of it. The English
woman made it into a beverage. They did not like it at
first, but later learned to be fond of it. Kitty’s mother
always made coffee Sunday mornings, and when she was
little she could always tell when Sunday came because
of the coffee-making,

“The bitter feeling against the tories of the Revolu-
tion lingered to Kitty's day, and she remembered the ex-
citement attending the return of two of them to that vi-
cinity. One of them was saved by a reprieve from the
president, which arrived just a half hour hefore the time
set for his execution. Another was secreted and hustled
off to New York by the ‘underground railway.’

‘“Mre, Rice remembered experiences of going to the
weekly market at Hagerstown with butter, eggs and
other things, which were part of the regular duties of
her childhood days. She was the youngest of the family
at home, and her father and mother wanted her to care
for them untilthey were gone. Tr‘s filial duty she was
very glad to fulfll to them, with all the love of a faithful
daughter, placing their interests and comforts always
before her own. It was not until she had buried her
father that she came west to join her youngest brother,
whom she survived twenty-eight years.

“Aunt Kitty knew her share of the trials and afflic-
tions of life, but instead of yielding to them or being
overcome, she was always thankful that they were no
worse. Her's was a beautiful spirit, and the trait just
mentioned shines through all her relations with fellow

men, and in the kindly sentiments with which no one
couil be with her any length of time without perceiving
it to be the ruling characteristic of her life. It was re-
freshing to receive the influence of such an association,
even though it was but for a chat of a few moments.”
Her funeral took place on Saturday, the 29th of De-
-cember, 1900. Services were conducted by Rev. Ephraim
Shellenberger, of the Mennonite church, near Freeport,
and Rev. F. W. Nazarine, Mt. Morris. Her funeral was
probably the largest ever held at that place. She was
laid to vest in Oakwood Cemetery beside her busband.

Mrd. Cynthia Hayns, P, O., Oskaloosa, Iowa. Jesse
Funk’s father dying when he was about fourteen years
old, he was left a poor boy without education, never hav-
ing attended school more than three months; and was
thus early thrown upon his own resources for a livelihood,
He began life by farming in connection with keeping a
little grocery store, which he carried on until 1838, when
he engaged in railroading for several years, and be-
came much involved indebt. Heagain returned to farm-
ing for several years, then engaged in the lumber bual-
ness in which he continued until 1850, during which time
he paid most of his debts. He then became interested in
the education of his family, and built a school house at
his own expense. It was the firat school house built in
the neighborhood. A teacher was employed by the neigh-
bors, and a minister was secured to preach for them,
whose services were owned and blessed of God, by the
conversion of Mr, Funk, his wife, two children, and about
twenty others. Previous to 1850 his life had been mostly
spent ‘among drunkards, gamblers, thieves, Indians,
panthers, wolves, wildcats, and wild hogs; without schools,
preaching, and without any moral training whatever.”
In 1854 he sold his little homestead for 82,800 (It is now ©
worth so many thousand), and moved on a farm of three
or four hundred acres in Stark Co., Ill., where he engaged
in rateing, buying, selling and shipping stock, until 1874,
and then moved to Mahaska Co., Iowa, where he engaged
in the same business until 1884, when he moved to Oska-
loosa, Iowa, where he and wife live in retirement witha
comfortable home and happy surroundings. Presby.

1V. Isaac Funk, bn. Nov. 17, 1707; died after a brief
{llneas at the home of his son, Duncan, in Bloomington,
IIL, Jan, 29, 1865, Mrd. Cassandra Sharp, of Peoria, IIL,
June, 1826.

Isaac Funk was born in Clark Co., Ky,, where the first
ten years of bis life was spent. Three or four of those
years he was of suitable age to attend school, but probably
there was no school at that time within the boy's reach,
The family removed to Fayette Co., Ohio, where sixteen
years of Mr, Funk's life were spent.

Isaac Funk's school life, all told, amounted to but
parts of three winters, this from the age of ten to thir-
teen. Nothing is known of the character of his teacher,
except that he was renowned as a very severe disciplin-
arian, even for that day; Mr, Funk often alluded to the
frequent and fearful thrashings that he gave his pupils;
all remembrance of the other qualifications of the
teacher, if he had any, seem to have faded from his mind.
We, who now know all about schooling, smile at the old-
time methods, and yet there must have been some kind
of virtue in those back woods schools, otherwise how-can
we explain the fact that e0 many boys of those days with
80 little schooling accomplished so much, while now so
many with so much schooling accomplish so little. Then,
with two or three years schooling, men built fortunes
and states; now many of us with twenty-two or three
years’ schooling are just about able to live off the state
or to squander a fortune.

In 1823 Mr. Funk started for Illinois; and in May of
the following year he pitched his camp on the east side,
just at the cdge of what is now known as Funk’s Grove,
On this spot, or very near it, he lived the rewainder of
his life. In partnership with his older brother, Absalom,
Mr. Funk began to farm a little with such rude imple-
ments as could be procured at that time in the new
country. As the settlement of the country increased, the
Funk brothers, Isaac and Absalom, began to buy the sur-
plus stock of the region and drive it to such markets as
they could find; first to Peoria, later to eastern markets
and to Chicago.

This business of handling cattle and hogs grew to
vast proportions. The brothers learned their business
well; they were alert, worked very hard, dealt fairly with
everybody, and thus gained a pretty complete monopoly
of the stock buying business of all their region; they
made money and a great deal of it. With the profits of
their stock business they bought land.

About 1840 the partnership was dissolved, Isaac con-
tinuing alone, still extending his live stock operations,
and still putting the profits into land. His operations in
handling stock and buying land were on a very large
ecale, .

The fertility and value of the prairie lands of central
Tlinois were not generally known to the first settlers, but
Mr, Funk evidently discovered very early after his arrival

* here, the matchless fertility of the prairie land, and no
doubt in the very first years of his residence here, con-
ceived the purpose of acquiring all he could of the land
in and around Funk’s Grove; to accomplish this purpose
he worked by day and by night. He pursued it with tre-
meudous energy and aplendid daring.

When the Illinois Central and Chicago and Alton
railways were projected and partly built, he foresaw that
lands would rapidly rise in value, and about that time in
the short space of three or four years, he bought more
than twelve thousand acres of land and went into debt to
the amount of $80,000, At the time of his death he owned
in McLean Co. 25,000 acres of land, 20,000 of it being in
one body in and around Funk’s Grove. We do not know
that any other man in the United States has, by his own
unaided efforta, acquired so much land equally valuable
and fertile, ae there is in the Funk's Grove tract, bought
and all paid for in Mr. Funk's lifetime.

Mr. Funk was a powerful man physically; he was five
feet ten and one-half inches in height, normal weight,
two hundred pounds; stout but not obese, finely propor-
tioned, compactly built, black hair inclined to curl,
Roman nose; long, strong upper lip; wide mouth, closing
firmly in handsome lines; complexion ruddy to dark, eyes
dark brown, clear. penetrating and eteady, but flashing
with power when aroused,

In politics Mr, Funk was a whig while that party was
stillin existence. In 1840 he was elected to the lower
house of the state legislature. While always taking an
active part and having an intelligent Interest in public
affaires, Mr. Funk was in no sense a politician, His great
business was sufficient to occupy most of his time and
always required the closest attention, but he was a broad
minded man and knew full well that be owed a duty to
his state and the public. While in no sense a politician,
he felt the keenest interest in public affairs and found
time to take an active part in the management of county
affairs and also in the conduct of political campaigns,
state and national.

He wasa member of the Republican Party from the
frst; he was not at fret an abolitionist, Mr. Funk was a
law-abiding citizen, trained to respect the rights of
Property, and while the laws of his country recognized
the right of Property in slaves, Mr, Funk abided those
laws. Just preceeding the war time, Hon. Owen Lovejoy,
candidate for Congress in Mr, Funk’s district, delivered a
&reat speech in Bloomington, Mr. Funk heard it; he was
converted and ever after hated slavery, and was ready to
welcome any lawful means of abolishing it from the land,

He was a Great friend of Abraham Lincoln, and
entered into the Lincoln Campaign of 1860 with all the
zeal and enthusiasm of his strongly emotional nature,
For the election of Lincoln he Gave up his time, labor

unexpired term of Gen. Richard J. Oglesby, and was re-
elected for the next term, It was during this term, in
the darkest days of the war of the Rebellion, when the
fate of the Union seemed to be trembling in the balance,
that he made his famous ®peech in the senate, in favor of
€0 appropriation for what was kuown as the Sanitary
Commission, The opponents of the war had @ majority
fu the Senate; they were Openly and Persistently oppos-
ing any and every measure Calculated to furnish aid and

conduct seemed nothing leas than treason to the country
and government, '

Be was unaccustomed to Speaking in public, but there
came a time when, in his Own words, he “could sit in his.
seat no longer and see men trifling with the luterests of
hiy Country.” It wag then that he arose and hurled at
the opposition that Philippic of PAilippics, which will
never be forgotten by those who heard tt, and is Probably
remembered by more People than remember any other
speech ever made in IMnots, The apeech ig as follows: :

Mk. SPxaxer: Can sit in my seat no longer and see
such boys’ Play going on. These men are trifiing with
the best {oterests of the country. They should have
asses’ cars to set off their heads, or they are Seceasionists
and traitors at heart,


============================================================

I say there are secessionists and traitors at heart in
this Senate. Their actions prove it. Their speeches
Prove it, Their gibes and laughter and cheers here
nightly, when their Speakers get up in this hall and
denounce the war and the administration, prove it.

what I think of them. And while so telling them, Iam re.
sponsible for what I say. Istand upon my own bottom. I
am ready to meet any man on this floor, in &ny manner from
a pin’s point to the mouth of a cannon, Upon this charge
against these traitors. (Tremendous applause from the
galleries.). I am an old man of sixty-five. I came to
IMnois a poor boy. I have made a little something for
myself and family. I Pay 63,000 a year in taxes; lam
willing to Pay 86,000, aye $12,000; (great cheering, the old

inketand to bound a half dozen inches into the air), aye, I
‘am willing to pay my whole fortune, and then give my
life to save my country from these traitors that are seek-
ing to destroy it, (Tremendous cheers and applause,
which the speaker Could not subdue.)

Mr. Speaker, you must please excuse me, I could
not sit longer in my seat and calmly listen to these
traitors, My heart that feels for my poor country would
not let me. My heart that cries out for the lives of our
brave volunteers in the fleld, that these traitors at home
are destroying by thousands, would not let me. My heart
that bleeds for the widows and orphans at home, would
not let me. Yes, these villains and traitors and seces-
sionists in this Senate (striking his Clenched fist on the
desk with a blow that made the house ring again), are
killing my neirbbors’ boys, now fighting in the field, I
dare to tell this to these traitors, to their faces, and that
Iam responsible for what I say to one and all of them,
(Cheers.) Let them come on, right here. Iam sixty-five
years old, and I have made Up my mind to risk my Hfe
right here, on this floor, for my country, .

These men sneered at Col. Mack a day or two ago.
He isa little man, but Il ama large man. I am ready to
meet any of them in place of Col. Mack, I am large
enough for them, and I hold myself ready for them now,
and at any time. (Cheers from the galleries,)

Mr. Speaker, these traitors on this floor should be
provided with hempel collars, Theydeserve them, They
deserve them. They deserve hanging, I say, ( Raising
his voice and violently striking the desk.) The country
would be better off to swing them up. I go for hanging
them and I dare tell them so right here to their traitors’
faces, Trattors should be hung. It would be the salva-
tion of the country to hang them. For that reason I
would rejoice at it. (Tremendous cheering. )

Mr. Speaker, I beg pardon of the gentlemen in the
Senate who are not traitors, but true, loyal men, for
what I have sald. -I only intend it and mean it for seces-
sionists at heart. They are here, in this Senate. I see
them joke, and srirk, and grin at a true Union man, but
Idefy them. I stand here ready for them and dare them
to come on. (Great cheering.) What man with the
heart of a patriot could stand this treason any longer.
(Cheers.) I denounce these men and their aiders and

abettors as rank traitors and secessionists, Hell itself .

could not spew out a more traitorous crew than some of
these men who disgrace this legislature, this state and
this country. For myself, I protest and denounce their
treasonable acts. Ihave voted against their measures.
I will do so to the end, I will denounce them as long as
God gives me breath, and I am ready to meet the traitors
themselves here or anywhere, and fight them to the
death. (Prolonged cheers and shouts. )

1 said I paid three thousand dollars a year taxes.
1 do not say it to brag of it. It ts my duty; yes, Mr.
Speaker, my privilege to doit. But some of the traitors
here, who are working night and day to get their miser-
able little bills and claims through the legislature to take
money out of the pockets of the people, are talking about
high taxes, They are hypocrites as well as traitors,
Iheard some of them talking about high taxes in this
way, who do not pay five dollars to support the govern:
ment, I denounce them as hypocrites as well as traitors.
(Cheers.) The reason they pretend to be afraid of high
taxes is that they do not want to vote money for the
relief of the soldiers, They want aleo to embarass the
government and stop the war. They want to ald the
secessionists to conquer our boys in the field, They care
about taxes! They are picayune men anyhow. They pay

============================================================

no taxes at all, and never did, and never hope to, unless
they can manage to plunder the government, (Cheers.)
This is an excuse for traitors. .

Mr, Speaker, excuse me! I feel for my country in
this hour of danger. I feel for her from the tip of my
toes to the end of my hair. That is the reaaon I speak as
Ido. Icannot help it, Iam bound to tell these men to
their teeth what they are, and what the people, the true
loyal people, think of them. 1

Mr. Speaker, I have had my say. Iam no speaker.
This is the only speech I have made, and 1 do not know
that it deserves to be called a speech. I could not ait
still any longer and see these scoundrels and traitors
work out their selfish schemes to destroy the Union.
They have my sentiments. Let them one and all make
the most of them. I am ready to back up all I say, and
repeat it, to meet these traitors in any manner they
may choose, from a pin’s point to the mouth of a canuon.”

The effect of thie speech in the army and among the
friends of the Union throughout the whole North can
scarcely be measured, coming as it did from the full
heart of a plain man, spontaneously. It aroused a sym-
pathetic echo in hundreds of thousands of breasts that
were pained as his was for his country, in the fearful
trials through which she was passing.

The remains of this remarkable man lie buried in
Funk's Grove Cemetery, remote from the traveled ways
and thronged towns, beside the still running stream and
in the heart of the same magnificent forest, which capti-
vated his eye when, as a young, strong man, he came
this way in search of home and fortune. By his side lie
the remains of his beloved and faithful wife, whose death
occurred only about four hours later than his, Mr. Funk
left a large family: they and their descendants have for
the most part, kept their residences in McLean county.
They are all engaged in agricultural pursuits, The
immense land holdings of Isaac Funk still remain in pos-
session of the family. Several of the sons have taken
considerable part in politics and other public business,
They are all republicans. Children: George, Adam,
Jacob, Duncan, Lafayette, Francis, Benjamin, Absalom,

‘Isaac, Sarah.

Children : Sarah, Nancy, Adam, John, Thomas, Delilah,
Mary, Infant, Absalom. On the ith day of March, 1825,
Mr. and Mrs. Funk moved into their new home, 4 jog
cabin, 12 x 14, with only one side of the roof covered.. A
planket served the purpose of a door, There was no
chimney, and no floor put the ground. Into this humble
dwelling they brought an ox cart load of household furni-
ture. He sold his wedding hat for a sow and ten pigs,
and split rails for his neighbors for twenty-five cents per
hundred. In 1830, when the land first came into market,
he entered his firet claim for 160 acres, and had by
this time laid up $1,400 with which he bought his first
quarter section, paying $200, and loaned 9800 to some of
his neighbors with which to buy their homes. The little
log cabin finally gave place to a brick dwelling. then

uite a mansion for this new country. His few acres
multiplied to thousands and his estate at his death was
valued at more than six hundred thousand dollars
(3600,000) which amount having left no will, was divided
equally among his seven children. For his success in
business he gave God the praise. A devout Christian,
he was a liberal giver to all church benevolences. From
an early day until his death it was his custom to give

he took the superannuated relation and only preached
occasionally and during revival work. He wasa good and
faithful preacher and always had a good attendance at
his services. He was a great favorite with the young
men of his circuits, and they were regular attendants.

After preaching some 16 years he engaged in pusiness
in order better to secure a home and competence for his
family. He was quite successful in business for a time,
then reverses came, and he saw his error. He resumed
preaching for a short time before his death. He did not
have the advantages that young people have now, put he
had a good common school education for the times.

After he began to preach he was a great student, and
devoted most of his time to study. Asa pastor and serv-
ant of Christ he was successful, and many were added to
the churches under his ministry. Meth. Ep. Children:

THE FUNCK FAMILY OF LANCASTER CO., PA.

From the history of Lancaster County, Pa., we learn
that the Funcks were among the Mennonites who emi-
grated to this country from Switzerland and the Palati-
nate in 1709, They were among those who settled in
Lancaster County. In this book is a map showing a grant
o’ land made by Henry Funck and John Funck and the
Herr’s occupy a prominent place. Under ‘Mennonites’
in Encyclopedia is given the time that Lancaster
County was settled by the Mennonites. It was under-
stood that four Funcks emigrated from Switzerland to
Holland, forced to leave on account of their religious
belief. Two of these brothers settled near Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania, and the other two are said to have settled
in Lancaster County. From an old Bible in possession of
Christian Herr of Lancaster, the Bible being more than
150 years old, we gather the following:—

Rudolph Funck was married to Catharine Krebile,
about the year 1776. Children: Maria, Henry, Magda-
lena, Catharine, Elizabeth.

It is not known to the writer, from which of the pio-
neers, Henry or John Funck, that Rudolph Funck de-
acends, There are probably one or two miseing links
between the pioneer ancestor and Rudolph.

From records and other information it has been
learned that the children of Henry Funck, were viz.,
Henry, John, Marvin, Jacob, Samuel, Barbara, wife of
Michael Meyer, Mary, wife of Jacob Nutt and Frena,
wife of Joseph Musser. The children of John Funck so
far as known were Christian, John, Jacob and others.

There is recorded in Lancaster County, Pennsyl- .
vania, the will of Henry Funck, dated 1736. It is written
in German.

There is also recorded in Philadelphia, the will of
Henry Funck, of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, made
in 1795 and probated in 1799. This may have been a
son of one of the pioneers. His children were, Catha-
rine, Maderira, Sophia Elliott, Sarah Musser, Jacob
Funck, and Elizabeth Branham.

After settling in Lancaster County for a time, later
some of the family, evidently the pioneer, John, drifted
to Virginia, but it is not known that any of this family
now reside there, In all probability they removed west
after about the year 1742.

Of wills of Funcks found recorded in the valley coun-
ties of Virginia are the following, viz: Will of Adam
Funck, Shenandoah County, dated March 10, 1778, pro-
bated April 30, 1778. His wife was Magdalene, and his
children, John, Adam, Abraham, Barbara, Catharine,
Mary, Dorothy, Elizabeth, Executor, Henry Frank and
William Kulp.

Will of Jacob Funck, Winchester County, Virginia,
probated 1746, wife, Frances. Children: Jacob, John,
Elizabeth, Frances, Mary and Barbara. He refers to a
cousin John, Jr., who was one of his executors,

The following extracts of deeds are from Orange

ings. When about 14 years of age he learned the weav-
ing trade. In 1833 he moved to Ohio and settled near
Clifton on the Little Miama River, in Green Co., in a lit-
tle hut, that haseince been destroyed. While there he
was engaged in the meat business and general merchan-
dise, also farming. He afterwards moved to Clifton,
Green Co., where he kept a hotel. As there were no
railroads at that time and a great deal of teaming from
various parts of the state to Cincinnati, many of the
teamsters spent the night at Clifton. About 1847 he re-
moved to Springfield, Ohio, where he kept a hotel known
as the Pennsylvania House, a large hostelery which
accommodated many of the teamsters who stopped for
the night on their way from Cleveland to Cincinnati. In
1849 he moved farther up town in Springfield and for
some time conducted a hotel but latterly went into busi-
ness. By investing in real estate in connection with his
business he accumulated about $200,000, half of which or
more he lost by going security, before he died. He was
a very kind hearted man and it was hard for him to re-
fuse a person who wished an accommodation. He was a
man of remarkable strength. He would frequently pick
up a barrrel of flour and hold it at arm’s length above his
head. He has been seen to lift a barrel of vinegar
weighing between four and five hundred pounds and
carry it quite along distance. He was in belief a Uni-
versalist, and his first wife was a Lutheran,

Mr. Steinberger is a remarkable artistic genius. He
has done much excellent work in the line of illustrating
for the Youth's Companion, Farm and Fireside, Frank Les-
lie’s Weekly, Harper's Weekly and other periodicals.
Some of his illustrations would do credit to a Dore,
Among his works of art which have attracted much at-
tention is the Snyder bust which has been highly praised
and reflects great credit upon hia talent and ability as
an artist. “The Accolade” a large picture which was
presented to every subscriber of $1.00 to the million dol-
lar relief fund of the Red Cross Society and Cuban
relief committee, represents Columbia, the allegorical
figures of the United States, bestowing the Accolade on
wounded Cuba. This work of art through the generous
efforts of the Funk & Wagnall’s Publishing Company,
cleared something over 85,000 for the Red Cross relief
committee during the Spanish-American war.

Another work named the “Beach Beauty,” a life
sized bust of a beautiful woman, has attracted a great
deal of attention, but perhaps the best proof of the ar-
tist’s power was displayed in a statuette of Christ. The
dark common clay was transformed into a figure of sim-
ple majesty. Its presence was a benediction,—it filled
the observer with sweetly solemn thoughts.

Mr. Steinberger’s work reflects great credit upon his
talents and ability as an artist of strong convictions and
great and powerful imagination and artistic feeling, and
he is in a fair way to be recognized among the noted and
honored sculptors of America and the art world,

He ie also a capital prose writer and a poet of no
mean attainments. .

Isaac K. Funk was graduated at Wittenberg College,
Springfield, O., D. D., in 1860, and in 1861 entered upon
active work in the Lutheran ministry near Moreshill, in
Indiana, subsequently holding pastoral charge at Carey,
O., and of the St. Matthews English Lutheran Church,
Brooklyn, N. Y. Among those who entered the church
during his ministry in Brooklyn is the now well known
Lutheran, Charles A. Scheiren, ex-mayor of that city.

After resigning his Brooklyn charge in 1872, which
position he had held for seven years, he traveled in Eu-
rope, Egypt and Palestine. About this time he became
the associate of Daniel Schindler, D. D., in the editorial
management of the Christian Radical, which was pub-
lished in Pittsburg, Pa., and afterwards removed to New
York City. In October, 1876, he founded The Homiletic Re-
view (then called The Metropolitan Pulpit), and was ite
editor-in-chief. The great publishing firm, of which he
is the president, is now known by the well-known name
of Funk & Wagnalls Company.

A. W, Wagnalls first began as a clerk in the publish-

. ing house, but in 1877 he became a partner, and the firm
was known as I. K, Funk & Co., and later as Funk & Wag-

nalls, and in 1891 as the Funk & Wagnalls Company, and -
has become one of the leading publishing houses of the
world, with branches in Canada and in England.:

Mr. Wagnalls had been a lawyer previously in Atchin-
eon, Kansas. Both he and Dr. Funk were born in Ohio,
and hence are both representatives of Western go-
ahead-ativeness, and they were both graduates of the
same college, that of Wittenberg, in Springfield, O. In
1877 the business was carried on in a small way in a room
where they simply had desk room at 21 Barclay St., on
the third foor. They remained in that room until they
crowded out all other tenante—then added an adjoining
room, and when that was full they had to rent a regular
store at 10-12 Dey St., where they occupied three floors;
continued at that place seven years, and had their force
and stock in three different buildings, and then, to se-
cure larger quarters, they moved to 18 and 20 Astor
Place; still later to 80 Lafayette Place, where the: busi-
ness now occupies seven large floors. Almost from the
start they were heavy publishers of books as well as of
periodicals.

About the year 1880 they began the publication of
cheap, paper-covered standard books, which had a great
run. One of the first heavy works they undertook was.
the re-publication of Spurgeon’s ‘‘Treasury of David”
(having gained permission from the author). This stand-
ard work on the Psalms has had an immense sale. Over
900 different works now bear the imprint of “Funk &
Wagnalls” as publishers. For the last eight or ten years
they have issued, on an average, about 500,000 volumes a
year! And still the books come pouring out from their
fruitful presses; all of the press work and binding and
nearly all the type setting being done in other buildings.
Among these volumes are such standard books as
Knight’s History of Eugland, Young’s Analytical Con-
cordance. The Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious
knowledge, The Hoyt-Ward Eucyclopedia of Practical
Quotations, Meyer's Commentary, complete in 11 vols.;
Butler's Bible Works, Parker’s Bible, complete in 26
vols; The Homiletic Commentary, 30 vols., etc., etc.
The crowning work published by this firm is the now
world famous book: The Funk & Wagnalle Standard
Dictionary of the English Language, the production of

which costing over $960,000, and having bad engaged
upon it 247 editors. Dr. Funk was the editor-in-chief of
this monumental work, having originated the plans and
superintended the editorial collaboration throughout,
producing a book that has commanded the admiration of
the Englieh epeaking world.

Among the authors whose books are printed by this
firm are Dr. Philip Schaff, Dr. Charles F. Deems, Edward
Everett Hale, Edgar Fawcett, Julian Hawthorne, How
ard Crosby, Bishop Vincent, Joseph Parker, Frances E.
Willard, Benson J. Lossing, ‘Josiah Allen’s Wife,’’ Joa-
quin Miller, Joseph Cook, T, De Witt Talmage, Lyman
Abbott, Dr. James M. Ludlow, Rev. Dr. Banks, and
others.

The Voice wae started in 1984—first ae a campaign
paper, of the Prohibition Party, on a trial of eight
weeks, Dr. Funk, editor-in-chief. The publishers ylelded
to a growing demand for its continuance. As a perma-
nent periodical it began its career January 2, 1985, with
6,000 subscribers. The paper reached a weekly circula-
tion of over 120,000, ;

Dr. Funk is distinguished for his gyeat energy—he is
asteam-engine and does not seem to tire, no matter how
hard he works, He is never ata loss as to argument in
controversy, nor for resourceful expedients in pushing
Duainess enterprises. Indeed that is his great power.
He does originate plans and in the commercial world, this
power is worth more than almost any other quality.

Asan editor his instinct for news is of the highest
order. Hie ideal of a paper is ever far beyond realiza-
tion—not because it is utopian (for such it is not) but
because of the difficulty of organizing a staff of compe-
tent, practical editors, having business partners com-
mensurate with his energy and breadth of ideas. In 1896
the degree of LL. D. was conferred on him by his Alma
Mater. :

- “Christian C. Funk was a well known contractor of
Springfield, Ohio, whose business engagements were met
with the utmost promptness and whose work was exe-
cuted in a thoroughly reliable manner. He was emi-
nently successful in the labor to which his facility in
the use of edged tools inclined him, and for which he
was naturally adapted. He also manifested excellent
judgment in the investments he made, and was uum-
bered among the capitalists of Springfield, O., where he
resided. His rcputation extended far beyond the limits
of hie own city, as he was also interested in some of the
booming towns of the south,

In 1885 Mr. Funk erected on West High St., Spring-
field, O., a substantial brick residence, which is of fine
architectural design and construction, elegantly finished
and richly furnished throughout. In political belief Mr.
Funk was a Prohibitionist. Hie social and benevolent
qualities found a certain outlet through his membership
in Ephraim Lodge, No. 146, 1.0.0. F. He was a stock-
holder and director in the Springfield Coffin Co.,
and was thus thoroughly identified with the business
interests of Springfield. He possessed to a large degree
those principles which are so essential to success, and by
careful attention to the details of his work, punctuality
and accuracy in application, made for himself a name
which will be long remembered. As a meteor flashing
across the sky leaves behind a path of soft and creamy
white, so the deeds of such a man remain after he has
gone into the great unknown.

Mrs. Funk is aleo a native of Ohio, and was princi-
pally reared and educated in Springfield. She possesses
many virtues and looks carefully to the ways of her
household, making her home the center of attraction for
her family. Luth. Children: Blanche, Martha.

Dr. B, F, Brownfield was a surgeon and physician In
the army from the beginning to the end of the Civil war.
Towards the close of the war he had charge of the
“Jackson, Michigan Hospital.” He was then a member

. of the 22nd Regiment, V.R.C. He died Apr. 24, 1878, at
Smithfield, Fayette Co., Pa. He had for months been
suffering from that fatal disease, consumption, but dur-
ing his long and painful illness, he never murmured nor
complained; and when at last he fell asleep it was in the
abiding faith, that through the merits of our Lord Jesus
Christ, he should “enter into that house, not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.’’ His remains were car-
ried to the Baptist Church of Smithfield, Pa., and the
Rey. R. Morgan of Connellsville, by the doctor's request, °
preached the funeral sermon. From the church the fu-
neral procession proceeded to the Baptist burying-ground
where all that was mortal of Dr, Brownteld was deposited
in the earth, with the usual and impressive ceremonies
of the Masonic and I. O, O. F. orders to both of which the
Doctor belonged. The funeral was largely attended, it
being estimated that not less than one thousand persons
were present. Children: Charles, Ardoth.

Emigrated to America, Sept. 29, 1733. Left Europe on
account of religious persecution. During the voyage
across the ocean a gon was born to them named Adam,
who was seven weeks old when he landed. The mother
died at the birth of Adam. On landing, Frederick left his
infant son Adam, in the care of friends in Philadelphia,
while he went away to look for business or a place to
settle, but was never heard of afterwards. It is possible
that he emigrated to Virgini-., where he may have lived
until his death. Besides his son Adam, it is probable that
he had a son Frederick, who being older, he probably
took with him to Virginia.

Wt. Frederick Funk, mrd, Catharine Kulp, from Bucks

far from Strasburg. It is said he went to Chillicothe, O.,

Frederick, Jacob, Michzl and fiye daughters; all of the

DESCENDANTS OF MARTIN FUNK.

Of the ancestors of this branch of the Funk Family,
and their arrival in this country, nothing definite could
be learned, Tradition tells about two brothers who came
from Europe to ‘America and upon their arrival here be-
came separated, and were never able to hear from each
other again. One of these brothers was the father of
Martin Funk, Sr.

"N Martin Funk, Sr., was born in 1755, and as is sup-
posed, lived in Stark Co., Ohio, where be died in 1839, at

- the age of 83 yrs., 10 my and 22 d, He wasa member of
the Mennonite church. Of his children we find the de-
acendants of one only, Jacob.

{, Jacob Funk, son of i. Martin Funk, was porn
Oct. 26, 1785. Lived in Stark Co., O, Saw-miller. Ger.
Bap, Mrd. Mary Bowers, Mar. 20, 1809, in Bedford county,
as shown by the marriage certificate, which was given by
Thomas Logan, J. P., who also performed the ceremony.
The certificate was signed by said Thomas Logan, the
contracting parties, Martin Funk, the father of Jacob,
and Jacob Bowers, father of the bride, and several others.
‘As there is no Bedford county in the state of Ohio, it is
altogether probable that the marriage took place in Bed-
ford Co., Pa., and th. both the Funk and Bowers familes
resided in that county and state, and afterwards moved
to Stark Co., Onto. First wife, Mary Bowers, died; leav-
ing two, sons: Jacob and Martin, Jacob mrd. as his
second wifé, Mary Palmer. Bhe died and Jacob mrd,

VALEDICTION.

DEAR FRIENDS: As we reach the close of this volume,
and ere we lay down our pen, we wish to add a few part-
ing words. In the preparation of this work we are
greatly indebted to many of the friends for favors in
furnishing much information, and otherwise aiding the
the work.

Among the more prominent of these are Mrs, Sue
Latshaw, of Spring City, Pa.; D. K. Cassel, who has since
gone to his eternal reward, and others already mentioned
in the preface of this work, and last but not least, Miss
Martha Funk, of Elkhart, Ind, to whom much credit is
due for valuable services rendered in spending much
time in aiding in the revising of the work, looking it over
carefully, correcting name» and gathering additional
matter from friends and relatives.

To our pioneer ancestors, whose names and deeds are
written in this book, we owe a debt of gratitude, fortheir
unflinching courage in the performance of duty, and
devotion to God. Nearly two centuries ago, deprived of
the blessings of religious liberty to worship God in a man-
ner acceptable to themselves in the “fatherland,” they
fled across the ocean to the shores of our own beloved
America, thena vast wilderness. Here they carved out
their homes, subdued the land, and lived modest unas-
suming lives, as humble tillers of the soil, In their new
homes they remembered the God of their fathers, and
from their humble firesides went up grateful songs of
praise to the God of every blessing, while from the family
altars ascended thankegivings from truly grateful hearts
in recognition of God’s bountiful mercies and kindly
leadings, Here they erected their shrines and altars,
and worshiped unmolested the God of all the earth, With-
in these templed walls erected in the long ago, their voices
were heard in the preached word, in testimony, in hearty
soul inspiring songs of praise, and faithful to the last,
these servants of God heard the higher summons and
their voices hushed in the silence of death, they went up.
to their crowns of glory and are now waiting for you and
me. Blessed be their memory.

Dear reader, let us take counsel of the fathers.
Consider the ‘aotives that led them to’ leave their
beloved homes inthe far-off fatherland, to brave the

storms and perils of the ocean for a wilderness home on
these shores, that it was not simply to better their con-
ditions in temporal affairs of this life, but as fol-
lowers of Jesus, the Salvation of their souls, and freedom
from religious oppression for themselves and their off-
spring were the paramount motives.

‘Mark their unselfish devotion to duty amid the per-
secutions in the old world and the trials and priva-
tions of pioneer life in this new world that made it pos-
sible for us to enjoy the freedom, bleseings and comforts
of the greatest country God ever gave to man. May we
ever bless their memory for their simple, childlike,
unyielding faith in God, and the world’s Redeemer. They
laid deep and firm the foundations of their faith in the
Crucified One, They fought well the battles of life, and
lived In peace with all mankind, And thus they have
passed on to their rewards. May their self-denying,
Godly lives and examples rest with benediction power
upon us, while we bide our time, and follow in their foot-
steps, preserving unsullied the family name.

Dear reader, are you a follower of Jesus? If not, let
me remind you of the saintly, godly ancestors whose
forms have so long slept in their quiet graves; of the suf-
fering for the faith; their victory in death; their crown-
ing in the Father's House, whence they await the home-
coming of the faithful loved ones. Jet me point you to
the Savior they loved, and to the God they served, Let
me entreat you to do likewise,

Oh, come surrender to the King of Kings,

The Sovereign Lord of all,
_ Before whose throne the fathers fall,

“And crown Him Lord of all.”

Come join the pilgrim band,
Whose eyes are upward turned,

Behold the hills the fathers gained,
And boldly forward go.

Come, the fathers bid you come, .,

And Jesus stands with outstretched hands
And pleads, poor dying one,

Here's food, shelter, rest and Home, Oh come,

Milton, N. J., March 27, 1901. A. J. FRETZ,

(not Silliman) Nov. 16, 1865. His father died when he
Was nearly seven years old, leaving five children to be
cared for in some way. His grandmother, Mrs. Joseph
Funk, having died some months previous, his grandfather
wrote his daughter, Marw to come back to the parental
roof and bring her children; that he would furnieh them
ahome. This offer was gladly accepted and in a few
months all were safely housed at Mountain Valley, now
the historic Singer's len, Rockingham Co., Va. It was
here at the tender age of nine years, that he was placed
in his grandfather Funk's printing office and initiated
into the mysteries of ink and type, of which he soon be-
came fond, as his subsequent years have proven. His ad-
vantages for securing an education were meagre, as the
world would say. A few monthe’ schooling in an old Vir-
ginia log school house were all he received in a public
ray but his grandfather had been a great schoolmaster
in his day, ani as the boy, Aldine, had to spend his days
and nights iu the same room with his grandfather, he had
some blessed opportunities to improve his mind, espe-
cially as he had access toa well stored library for that
day, and was led, not forced to study works of history,
volumes of poetry, legendary lore and the Bible,

At the age of fifteen he began to write verses and to
compose music. Many of these puerile efforts were pub-
Hshed before he became a ears mot age. th b

a the year fosep! nk an ns began the pu
lication of the Southern Musical Advocate with which he
became associated as co-editor and contributor. This
x urnal continued to be published until 1860, when Aldine

. Kieffer cast his lot as a volunteer in the Confederate
States, so-called, and followed the fortunes of that war
until ite close, having participated in all the battles from
July 21, 1861, until May 12, 1864, when he was made a pris-
ouer of war and sent to Fort Deleware, Here he man-
aged to secure a tutor, Mr. Adams, a graduate of the:

niversity of Virginia, under whom he took lessons in
Latin, Algebra and Geometry, paying his tuition fees in

On May 12, 1865, he arrived at his mother’s home and
began to look about for something to do to make a liy. .
ing. His grandfather's printing office was a mess of pt
and a mass of ruins. He set about to revive and rejuve-

nate the old office, which, by the aid of his uncles, be
succeeded in doing, and the publication of the Advocate
was resumed.

In the latter part of the year 1265, he began his life
work, viz: writing hymns, music, and editing . music

ks.
The first book with which be associated was, The
Harp, of which over one hundred and twenty-
five chousand copiet weresold. Then followed “School Day
Singer.” “Glad rosannas,’” ‘* ed King’? and la-
ter, “The Tem le Star,” on which his fame if any, chiefly
reste. His volume of poems entitled, ‘Hours of Fancy,
has received many flattering notices, whilet his songs, -
“My Mountain Home,” “Grave on the Green Hillside,”
“The City of Light” and wpray fer the Wanderer” are
favorites everywhere. Res., agton Va. Children:

Wife leans her head upon my arm,
She thinks of him, I know;

Her thoughts are bus; with that land
Where we, some day, may g0.

1 think of those who lie asleep,—
Whose hearts are sinless etre

Oh Christ!’ I tremble when think

: ~"<How hearts are oft beset!

I wonder where their little feet
May have to walk some day?

If rough with stones, beset with thorns,
Or smooth and sweet the way?

I wonder what their little hands
May find life’s toil to be;

If doing good, or workin ill?
Oh God! [ trust to thee.

I wonder what their little lips
May speak in years to come,

If comely speech, with wisdom spiced,
Or stammering, crazed with rum?

I know that one has gone to rest—
Safe, happy, free from sin;

Thy garden walks aresweet, O Lord,
Lead Thou these others in!

Wife, from her reverie awakes—
‘And looking up, I say,

Your knitting, love—the books I prize,
‘Will soon be laid away.

Has Christ wrought out for us a robe,
From spot and blemish free, —
That we, and ours, may wear at last?
