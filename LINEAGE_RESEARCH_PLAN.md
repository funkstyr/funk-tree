## DISCREPANCIES TO INVESTIGATE

### 1. Spouse Discrepancy for Henry Funk
- **Your hypothesis**: Henry Funk (1732) married Martha Ann Killheffer/Margaretha Ziegler
- **Records show**: Henry Funk II (1730) married Barbara Showalter

**Possible explanations:**
- Different Henry Funks (cousins, etc.)
- Second marriage not documented
- Oral family history confusion

### 2. Birth Year Discrepancy for John Funk
- **Your hypothesis**: Rev. John Funk born Sep 27, 1759
- **Records show**: John (son of Henry II) born 1764

**Possible explanations:**
- Different John Funks (there were several)
- Date recording error
- John could be from a different Funk line

## SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS

1. **Add yourself to WikiTree** - Create profiles for your known direct ancestors (Donald, Aaron Barton, Amos, Aaron)

2. **Search 1850 Census** - Aaron Funk would have been ~15 years old. Look for him living with parents in Pennsylvania.

3. **Check 1860 Census** - Aaron would be ~25, possibly married. His parents might be listed nearby.

4. **Contact USFunks.net** - They have extensive Funk research and might have information on your line.

5. **Run WikiTree crawler again** - Continue fetching more profiles that might include your ancestors.
