## Your Stated Lineage Analysis

You mentioned this lineage:
1. Heinrich Funk (1690) - **MATCHES: Bishop Henry Funck**
2. His second son Henry Funk (1729) - **MATCHES: Henry Funk II**
3. His second son Christian Funk (1763) - **MATCHES: Christian Funk III (born Feb 9, 1763)**
4. Henry Funk (1784) - **POTENTIAL ISSUE** (see below)
5. John H Funk (1807) - **See multiple matches below**
6. Aaron Funk - **FOUND** (see below)

### Issue with Generation IV (Henry Funk, 1784)

According to the book, Christian Funk III (b. 1763) had children:
- Elizabeth, Henry, Christian, Susanna, Catharine, Barbara, Abraham, Rebecca, Christian, Mary, Franey

However, the book indicates:
> "IV. Henry Funk, died an infant."
> "IV. Christian Funk, died an infant."

This suggests the Henry Funk who was Christian III's son died young. Your lineage may pass through a different branch.

3. Christian Funk (III) - b. 1763
4. [Different child than Henry who died infant]

## Recommendations for Further Research

1. **Verify the Jacob Funk (IV) connection** - The Jacob Funk (IV) born 1797 who is grandfather of Aaron Funk needs to be traced back to determine which Generation III person is his father.

2. **Cross-reference with other records:**
   - Chester County, PA land records
   - Mennonite church records
   - Virginia land records for the branch that moved to Rockingham County

3. **Check the book's index** - The book mentions an "Index of Branches" and "General Index" that list all descendants 18 years and older with page references.

4. **DNA testing** - Modern DNA genealogy services can help confirm connections to other Funk descendants.

5. **Contact historical societies:**
   - Mennonite Historical Society
   - Montgomery County Historical Society
   - Chester County Historical Society
   - Rockingham County (VA) Historical Society

## Notes on OCR Quality

The PDF is a scanned book from 1899. OCR errors observed include:
- Dates may have digit errors (e.g., "1624" instead of "1824")
- Roman numerals sometimes misread (lowercase "i" vs "I")
- Some names may have minor spelling variations

The full OCR text file can be searched for specific names and dates.

```

### Why This Branch Is Not in the 1899 Book

The Fretz book explicitly states "Descendants not found" for several branches. Henry Funk II's children are listed on page 153 as:
> "Children: Jacob, Christian, Abraham, Elizabeth, Barbara, Henry, Esther, Susanna, John, Samuel, Joseph, Frances, Daniel."

While Jacob (III), Christian (III), and Joseph (III - the famous music publisher at Singers Glen, VA) are extensively documented, **John (III) and several other siblings have no detailed descendant listings in the book.**

This is a common pattern in 19th-century genealogies where some branches responded to the author's requests for information while others did not.

### Book References for Context
